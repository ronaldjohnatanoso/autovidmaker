58
00:00:29,591 --> 00:00:29,731
It's

59
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:30,431
wild,

60
00:00:30,873 --> 00:00:31,393
untamed,

61
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:31,635

84
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:40,692
Evolution

85
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:40,911

heat,

93
00:00:43,616 --> 00:00:43,716

94
00:00:43,817 --> 00:00:44,357
voila!

95
00:00:44,598 --> 00:00:44,779
You've

96
00:00:44,819 --> 00:00:44,959
got
