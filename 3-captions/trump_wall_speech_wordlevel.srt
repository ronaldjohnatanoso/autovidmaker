1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:00,632
My

2
00:00:00,812 --> 00:00:01,193
fellow

3
00:00:01,353 --> 00:00:02,013
Americans,

4
00:00:02,475 --> 00:00:02,875
today

5
00:00:02,895 --> 00:00:02,915
I

6
00:00:02,935 --> 00:00:03,616
am

7
00:00:03,676 --> 00:00:04,157
announcing

8
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:04,718
something

9
00:00:04,798 --> 00:00:04,937
that

10
00:00:05,118 --> 00:00:05,719
nobody

11
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,200
ever

12
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:06,621
thought

13
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:07,301
possible.

14
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:08,122
We

15
00:00:08,182 --> 00:00:08,503
are

16
00:00:08,603 --> 00:00:08,984
going

17
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:09,224
to

18
00:00:09,365 --> 00:00:09,765
build

19
00:00:09,785 --> 00:00:09,804
a

20
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:10,707
wall.

21
00:00:11,368 --> 00:00:11,468
But

22
00:00:11,528 --> 00:00:11,708
not

23
00:00:11,747 --> 00:00:11,968
just

24
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:12,329
any

25
00:00:12,409 --> 00:00:12,750
wall.

26
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:13,510
We

27
00:00:13,691 --> 00:00:13,771
are

28
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:14,151
going

29
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:14,371
to

30
00:00:14,512 --> 00:00:14,893
build

31
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:14,952
a

32
00:00:15,253 --> 00:00:15,694
wall

33
00:00:15,734 --> 00:00:16,054
on

34
00:00:16,254 --> 00:00:16,916
Mars.

35
00:00:17,457 --> 00:00:17,777
Yes,

36
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:19,660
Mars.

37
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:19,879
Now

38
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:20,280
people

39
00:00:20,381 --> 00:00:20,640
say,

40
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:21,321
why

41
00:00:21,402 --> 00:00:21,882
Mars?

42
00:00:22,382 --> 00:00:22,562
Why

43
00:00:22,603 --> 00:00:22,763
not

44
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:23,103
stick

45
00:00:23,163 --> 00:00:23,242
to

46
00:00:23,422 --> 00:00:23,684
Earth?

47
00:00:24,263 --> 00:00:24,364
And

48
00:00:24,504 --> 00:00:24,583
I

49
00:00:24,704 --> 00:00:25,004
say,

50
00:00:25,464 --> 00:00:25,704
look

51
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:26,506
around.

52
00:00:26,565 --> 00:00:27,387
Earth

53
00:00:27,507 --> 00:00:27,586
is

54
00:00:27,746 --> 00:00:28,248
fine.

55
00:00:28,288 --> 00:00:28,748
We

56
00:00:28,847 --> 00:00:29,189
fixed

57
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:29,368
it.

58
00:00:29,748 --> 00:00:29,908
We

59
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:30,169
made

60
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:30,769
America

61
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:31,250
great

62
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:31,670
again.

63
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,371
We

64
00:00:32,472 --> 00:00:32,991
rebuilt

65
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:33,152
the

66
00:00:33,252 --> 00:00:33,832
economy.

67
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:34,292
We

68
00:00:34,353 --> 00:00:34,573
made

69
00:00:34,713 --> 00:00:35,134
space

70
00:00:35,234 --> 00:00:35,634
force.

71
00:00:36,054 --> 00:00:36,155
And

72
00:00:36,234 --> 00:00:36,575
now

73
00:00:36,734 --> 00:00:36,856
it's

74
00:00:36,915 --> 00:00:37,235
time

75
00:00:37,295 --> 00:00:37,396
to

76
00:00:37,475 --> 00:00:37,996
protect

77
00:00:38,017 --> 00:00:38,756
American

78
00:00:38,936 --> 00:00:39,417
interests

79
00:00:39,718 --> 00:00:39,898
where

80
00:00:39,978 --> 00:00:40,378
nobody

81
00:00:40,518 --> 00:00:40,719
else

82
00:00:40,819 --> 00:00:40,878
is

83
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:41,259
willing

84
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:41,359
to

85
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:41,740
go.

86
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:42,701
Outer

87
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:43,441
space.

88
00:00:44,262 --> 00:00:44,843
Mars

89
00:00:44,883 --> 00:00:45,082
is

90
00:00:45,143 --> 00:00:45,222
the

91
00:00:45,323 --> 00:00:45,582
next

92
00:00:45,662 --> 00:00:46,323
frontier.

93
00:00:46,384 --> 00:00:47,125
It's

94
00:00:47,265 --> 00:00:47,604
red,

95
00:00:48,066 --> 00:00:48,286
just

96
00:00:48,365 --> 00:00:48,566
like

97
00:00:48,606 --> 00:00:48,686
the

98
00:00:48,786 --> 00:00:49,646
hats.

99
00:00:49,627 --> 00:00:50,048
But

100
00:00:50,088 --> 00:00:50,188
we

101
00:00:50,228 --> 00:00:50,408
don't

102
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:50,648
know

103
00:00:50,747 --> 00:00:50,929
who

104
00:00:51,048 --> 00:00:51,128
or

105
00:00:51,209 --> 00:00:51,389
what

106
00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:51,529
is

107
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:51,770
out

108
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:52,109
there.

109
00:00:52,691 --> 00:00:52,871
Could

110
00:00:52,911 --> 00:00:53,011
be

111
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:53,290
good

112
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:53,712
things.

113
00:00:54,112 --> 00:00:54,292
Could

114
00:00:54,353 --> 00:00:54,453
be

115
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:54,813
very

116
00:00:54,893 --> 00:00:55,213
bad

117
00:00:55,314 --> 00:00:55,694
things.

118
00:00:56,195 --> 00:00:56,676
Nobody

119
00:00:56,735 --> 00:00:57,195
knows.

120
00:00:57,796 --> 00:00:57,917
But

121
00:00:57,976 --> 00:00:58,097
we

122
00:00:58,156 --> 00:00:58,317
do

123
00:00:58,357 --> 00:00:58,537
know

124
00:00:58,618 --> 00:00:58,917
this.

125
00:00:59,539 --> 00:00:59,698
We

126
00:00:59,738 --> 00:00:59,918
will

127
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,219
not

128
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:00,600
allow

129
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,161
Mars

130
00:01:01,201 --> 00:01:01,381
to

131
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:01,561
be

132
00:01:01,781 --> 00:01:02,442
overrun

133
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:02,703
by

134
00:01:02,743 --> 00:01:03,743
unknowns.

135
00:01:04,204 --> 00:01:04,385
Not

136
00:01:04,484 --> 00:01:04,564
on

137
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:04,805
my

138
00:01:04,885 --> 00:01:05,266
watch.

139
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:06,007
Not

140
00:01:06,227 --> 00:01:06,307
on

141
00:01:06,668 --> 00:01:06,787
our

142
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:07,268
watch.

143
00:01:07,929 --> 00:01:08,069
So

144
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:08,290
we

145
00:01:08,349 --> 00:01:08,450
are

146
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:08,790
going

147
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:08,950
to

148
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:09,391
build

149
00:01:09,411 --> 00:01:09,430
a

150
00:01:09,811 --> 00:01:10,152
big,

151
00:01:10,611 --> 00:01:11,332
beautiful

152
00:01:11,453 --> 00:01:11,953
wall.

153
00:01:12,435 --> 00:01:12,555
The

154
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:13,055
biggest

155
00:01:13,155 --> 00:01:13,456
wall

156
00:01:13,516 --> 00:01:13,775
you've

157
00:01:13,876 --> 00:01:14,057
ever

158
00:01:14,177 --> 00:01:14,557
seen.

159
00:01:14,617 --> 00:01:15,177
The

160
00:01:15,278 --> 00:01:15,819
Martian

161
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:16,900
wall.

162
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:17,100
and

163
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:17,281
it's

164
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:17,602
going

165
00:01:17,662 --> 00:01:17,701
to

166
00:01:17,802 --> 00:01:18,043
keep

167
00:01:18,183 --> 00:01:18,304
out

168
00:01:18,564 --> 00:01:19,146
everything

169
00:01:19,186 --> 00:01:19,466
we

170
00:01:19,587 --> 00:01:19,847
don't

171
00:01:19,968 --> 00:01:20,310
want.

172
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:21,231
Dust

173
00:01:21,352 --> 00:01:21,914
storms,

174
00:01:22,334 --> 00:01:22,715
rogue

175
00:01:22,775 --> 00:01:23,879
robots,

176
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,460
possibly

177
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,043
illegal

178
00:01:25,242 --> 00:01:25,724
aliens,

179
00:01:26,025 --> 00:01:26,105
and

180
00:01:26,146 --> 00:01:26,245
I'm

181
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:26,427
not

182
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:26,847
talking

183
00:01:26,908 --> 00:01:27,108
about

184
00:01:27,149 --> 00:01:27,248
the

185
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:27,569
kind

186
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:27,750
from

187
00:01:27,831 --> 00:01:28,231
across

188
00:01:28,292 --> 00:01:28,371
the

189
00:01:28,432 --> 00:01:28,813
border,

190
00:01:29,233 --> 00:01:29,355
I'm

191
00:01:29,415 --> 00:01:29,775
talking

192
00:01:29,835 --> 00:01:30,076
about

193
00:01:30,117 --> 00:01:30,216
the

194
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:30,578
kind

195
00:01:30,638 --> 00:01:30,799
with

196
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:32,322
antennas.

197
00:01:32,302 --> 00:01:32,602
They

198
00:01:32,683 --> 00:01:32,903
said

199
00:01:32,963 --> 00:01:33,084
we

200
00:01:33,144 --> 00:01:33,424
couldn't

201
00:01:33,483 --> 00:01:33,724
build

202
00:01:33,784 --> 00:01:33,805
a

203
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:34,144
wall

204
00:01:34,305 --> 00:01:34,385
on

205
00:01:34,465 --> 00:01:34,745
Earth.

206
00:01:35,206 --> 00:01:35,305
And

207
00:01:35,365 --> 00:01:35,546
we

208
00:01:35,647 --> 00:01:35,966
did.

209
00:01:36,007 --> 00:01:36,668
Now

210
00:01:36,727 --> 00:01:36,888
they

211
00:01:36,968 --> 00:01:37,168
say

212
00:01:37,227 --> 00:01:37,367
we

213
00:01:37,427 --> 00:01:37,688
can't

214
00:01:37,748 --> 00:01:37,989
build

215
00:01:38,168 --> 00:01:38,248
one

216
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:38,469
on

217

Mars.

218
00:01:39,771 --> 00:01:39,911
And

219
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:40,292
we

220
00:01:40,412 --> 00:01:40,792
will.

221
00:01:40,852 --> 00:01:41,992
Faster.

222
00:01:42,414 --> 00:01:42,914
Cheaper.

223
00:01:43,314 --> 00:01:44,016
Stronger.

224
00:01:44,475 --> 00:01:44,656
Made

225
00:01:44,715 --> 00:01:44,855

steel.

231
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:48,881
We

232
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,081

233
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:49,361

best

236
00:01:49,962 --> 00:01:50,503
builders.

237
00:01:50,882 --> 00:01:50,983
The

238
00:01:51,043 --> 00:01:51,584
smartest

239
00:01:51,623 --> 00:01:52,424

Elon

241
00:01:53,445 --> 00:01:53,665

He

244
00:01:54,527 --> 00:01:54,826
loves

245
00:01:54,927 --> 00:01:55,628
Mars.

246
00:01:55,608 --> 00:01:56,028
Maybe

247
00:01:56,108 --> 00:01:56,308
too

248
00:01:56,368 --> 00:01:56,629
much,

249
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:57,069
but

250
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:57,391
that's

251
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,031
okay.

252
00:01:58,311 --> 00:01:58,552
We'll

253
00:01:58,593 --> 00:01:58,753
get

254
00:01:58,813 --> 00:01:58,852
it

255
00:01:58,933 --> 00:01:59,254
done.

256
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:00,015
And

257
00:02:00,114 --> 00:02:00,436
folks,

258
00:02:00,756 --> 00:02:01,137
listen.

259
00:02:01,597 --> 00:02:02,058
Mars

260
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:02,819
will

261
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:03,340
be

262
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,141
great.

263
00:02:04,742 --> 00:02:05,082
Safe,

264
00:02:05,664 --> 00:02:06,284
secure,

265
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:06,926
and

266
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:07,447
red.

267
00:02:08,168 --> 00:02:08,649
Very

268
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:09,169
red.

269
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:09,971
It's

270
00:02:10,111 --> 00:02:10,491
going

271
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:10,793
to

272
00:02:10,932 --> 00:02:11,212
be

273
00:02:11,614 --> 00:02:12,414
tremendous.

274
00:02:13,036 --> 00:02:13,336
God

275
00:02:13,396 --> 00:02:13,736

Force,

281
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:16,902

289

290
00:02:20,568 --> 00:02:20,949
soon,

291
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,711
Mars.
