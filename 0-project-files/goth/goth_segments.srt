You fumble the goth, Mommy. Yeah, you really did. She gave you a look that said, ruin me or enlighten me. And you responded like a substitute math teacher asking where the bathroom is. She opened with a dad joke. She had neck tattoos and a playlist named Unholy Communion. And you asked if she liked Marvel movies. Game is game.

00:00:29,073 --> 00:00:58,417
She posted a thirst trap. You replied, huh, vibes. You triped queen and hit send like it was currency. No context, no substance, no spell resistance. You think words are spells. You forgot to roll for charisma. I once dated a goth girl who had a pet raven named Carl. Not short for anything, just Carl. She made me walk him on a leash made of teeth.

00:00:58,417 --> 00:01:19,867
Did I ask questions? No, I simply adjusted. You asked to what her rising sign was. She said, Scorpio, Pisces moon, death in Venus. You said, cool, I'm a Sagittarius, I think. She said nothing. The silence hit different. That was not rejection. That was spiritual evaporation.

00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:44,150
You cannot out-nice someone into passion. You cannot mean your way into her trauma. She wanted a co-pilot for the abyss. You showed up with a bucket hat and an air fryer. She asked, do you ever think about the void? You said, ha, yeah, like Mondays, right? She vanished like mist. She did not block you. She transcended you.

00:01:44,150 --> 00:02:13,123
There is no shame here, only data. You logged a failure. That is experience now. Level one barred, no charisma. But hey, you are in the game. I once sent a goth girl a Spotify playlist called Moonlit Angst. She sent back one called Try Again Never. I respected that. Game was played. She won. I learned.

00:02:13,123 --> 00:02:41,574
You heard you're sweet and thought it was hope. It was not. That was the kindness before the execution. You tried. You lost. The universe gave you one side quest. Hold her interest for three minutes. You got distracted by her septum ring and started talking about your podcast idea. She once wore a shirt that said, eat the rich. And you replied, huh, I love that show. Brother.

7
00:02:41,574 --> 00:03:07,073
That was not a reference. That was a manifesto. And you turned it into Netflix Smalltalk. You do not need to feel bad. She was lightning. You were dry brass. There was no version of this where you did not catch fire. You were not friendzoned. You were lore dropped. She will tell the tale at brunch like a ghost story. And everyone will nod.

00:03:07,073 --> 00:03:36,992
Next time, do not quote the office. Next time, do not say, you're not like other girls. Next time, wait, there might not be a next time. Game is game. So light a candle, write a haiku, get in the gym, learn what moon in the eighth house means. And if another goth mommy crosses your path, look her in the eyes. Say nothing dumb. And remember, you were never the villain.

00:03:36,992 --> 00:03:42,915
just the backstory. But damn if you were not almost interesting.
