Speaker 1: <p1 image_prompt="rusted vending machine that only dispenses rejection letters, flickering light above it buzzing like disappointment">You fumbled the goth mommy. Yeah. You really did. </p1>

<p2 image_prompt="plush heart with a knife in it sitting on a rotating display table under a sign that says ‘AS IS – NO RETURNS’">She gave you a look that said ‘ruin me or enlighten me’—and you responded like a substitute math teacher asking where the bathroom is.</p2>

<p3 image_prompt="a cobwebbed bookshelf labeled ‘how to talk to women’ with every book missing except one: 'Chapter 1 – Do Not Speak'">You opened with a dad joke.
She had neck tattoos and a playlist named ‘unholy communion.’
And you asked if she liked Marvel movies.
Game is game.</p3>

<p4 image_prompt="an alley full of love letters folded into paper airplanes, all crashed, all soggy, one labeled ‘u up?’ written in Comic Sans">She posted a thirst trap. You replied, ‘haha vibes.’
You typed ‘queen’ and hit send like it was currency.
No context. No substance. No spell resistance.
You think words are spells. You forgot to roll for charisma.</p4>

<p5 image_prompt="old Nokia phone duct-taped to a sage bundle, buzzing nonstop, but only from notifications that say 'she’s not into you, bro'">I once dated a goth girl who had a pet raven named Carl.
Not short for anything. Just Carl.
She made me walk him on a leash made of teeth.
Did I ask questions? No. I simply adjusted.</p5>

<p6 image_prompt="photo album titled ‘what could’ve been,’ full of blurry selfies, ghost emojis, and screenshots of ‘last seen 2h ago’">You asked her what her rising sign was.
She said Scorpio, Pisces moon, death in Venus.
You said ‘cool I’m a Sagittarius I think.’
She said nothing.
The silence hit different.
That was not rejection. That was spiritual evaporation.</p6>

<p7 image_prompt="a museum exhibit titled ‘Ls Taken,’ featuring shattered ego statues and a shattered ego guestbook">You cannot ‘out-nice’ someone into passion.
You cannot meme your way into her trauma.
She wanted a co-pilot for the abyss.
You showed up with a bucket hat and an air fryer.</p7>

<p8 image_prompt="treadmill in a cemetery, still running, with sneakers left behind mid-stride; nearby tombstone reads 'he tried, kind of'">She asked, “Do you ever think about the void?”
You said, “Haha yeah like Mondays, right?”
She vanished like mist.
She did not block you.
She transcended you.</p8>

<p9 image_prompt="a plastic participation trophy melting in the sun, engraved with 'at least you showed up (barely)'">There is no shame here.
Only data.
You logged a failure. That is experience now.
Level one bard. No charisma. But hey—you are in the game.</p9>

<p10 image_prompt="cracked crystal ball showing a slideshow of every cringe moment in your DMs; fortune cookie beside it reads 'she saw the meme'">I once sent a goth girl a Spotify playlist called ‘Moonlit Angst.’
She sent back one called ‘Try Again Never.’
I respected that.
Game was played.
She won.
I learned.</p10>

<p11 image_prompt="calendar page with every date scratched out except one: 'THE DAY SHE SAID “you’re sweet” – autopsy pending'">You heard “you’re sweet” and thought it was hope.
It was not.
That was the kindness before the execution.</p11>

<p12 image_prompt="old arcade machine titled ‘FLIRTING: THE GAME’, screen cracked, coin slot jammed with quarters, scoreboard says 'YOU – 0'">You tried.
You lost.
The universe gave you one side quest: hold her interest for 3 minutes.
You got distracted by her septum ring and started talking about your podcast idea.</p12>

<p13 image_prompt="haunted photo booth with photos of failed flirts stuck to the walls; each one has 'nice guy energy detected' burned into the corner">She once wore a shirt that said ‘Eat The Rich’ and you replied, ‘Haha I love that show!’
Brother.
That was not a reference.
That was a manifesto.
And you turned it into Netflix small talk.</p13>

<p14 image_prompt="weathered tombstone that reads 'Here lies your shot – it had potential' surrounded by pigeons judging you">You do not need to feel bad.
She was lightning.
You were dry grass.
There was no version of this where you did not catch fire.</p14>

<p15 image_prompt="snow globe filled with tears, tiny figurines inside reenacting the moment she said ‘you’re like a brother to me’">You were not friendzoned.
You were lore-dropped.
She will tell the tale at brunch like a ghost story.
And everyone will nod.</p15>

<p16 image_prompt="tattered journal titled 'notes on her eyeliner,' every page smudged by tears and bad takes">Next time, do not quote The Office.
Next time, do not say “you’re not like other girls.”
Next time—
Wait.
There might not be a next time.
Game is game.</p16>

<p17 image_prompt="a bench under a blood moon, plaque reads ‘For the ones who almost pulled it off’">So light a candle.
Write a haiku.
Get in the gym.
Learn what ‘moon in the eighth house’ means.
And if another goth mommy crosses your path?
Look her in the eyes.
Say nothing dumb.
And remember—</p17>

<p18 image_prompt="t-shirt hanging in a thrift store, reads 'She Was Never Yours – It Was Just Your Turn To Lose'">You were never the villain.
Just the backstory.
But damn if you were not almost interesting.</p18>
