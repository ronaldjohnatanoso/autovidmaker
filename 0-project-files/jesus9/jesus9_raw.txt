Speaker 1: Jesus said TWO WORDS and the Pharisees immediately wanted to MURDER Him! What were they?
They asked, "Who do You think You are?"
Jesus answered with the most SHOCKING claim ever made!
He said, "I AM!"
They INSTANTLY grabbed rocks to stone Him!
Because "I AM" is GOD'S name from the burning bush!
Jesus just claimed to BE God Himself!
They threw stones but Jesus vanished!
Either He's the biggest liar ever or He's GOD!
Which do YOU believe?
Type AMEN if you believe Jesus is God! Subscribe for more truth!
