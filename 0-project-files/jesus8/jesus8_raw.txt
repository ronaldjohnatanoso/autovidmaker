Speaker 1: STOP! This Bible verse makes Satan LITERALLY run away screaming! Want to see demons flee?
Even hearing these words makes hell tremble!
It's James 4:7 and it's LOADED with power!
"Submit to God. RESIST the devil..."
"...and he WILL flee from you!"
When you stand in God's authority, darkness has NO power!
Say it out loud: "I RESIST you, Satan!"
Watch every attack crumble!
You have MORE power than you think!
Speak it: "Satan, I RESIST you in Jesus' name!"
Type AMEN if you felt that power! Subscribe for more spiritual warfare weapons!
