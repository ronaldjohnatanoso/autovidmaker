57
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:33,173
It's

58
00:00:33,314 --> 00:00:33,816
wild,

59
00:00:34,237 --> 00:00:34,878
untamed,

64
00:00:36,362 --> 00:00:36,482

83
00:00:45,326 --> 00:00:46,210
Evolution

84
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:46,390

92
00:00:49,442 --> 00:00:49,542
and

93
00:00:49,662 --> 00:00:50,646
voila,

94
00:00:51,088 --> 00:00:51,390
you've

95
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:51,610
got

96
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:51,670
