Objection. The ocean is not soup. Soup is something you eat, something crafted with intention, with ingredients selected by a chef. And yet, the ocean contains water, minerals, microscopic plankton, even bits of organic matter floating about, just like a well-stirred broth.

A broth is controlled. It simmers on a stove. It has seasoning. The ocean, it's wild, untamed and filled with creatures that would bite your face off if you called them dinner. But isn't life itself just nature's recipe unfolding? Evolution as the cook, time as the simmering heat, and voila! You've got a bubbling cauldron of marine biodiversity.
