SHOUT ALOUD
Speaker 1: OBJECTION! THE OCEAN IS NOT SOUP.
SOUP IS SOMETHING YOU EAT. SOMETHING CRAFTED WITH INTENTION, WITH INGREDIENTS SELECTED BY A CHEF.
Speaker 2: AND YET, THE OCEAN CONTAINS WATER, MINERALS, MICROSCOPIC PLANKTON, EVEN BITS OF ORGANIC MATTER FLOATING ABOUT—JUST LIKE A WELL-STIRRED BROTH!
Speaker 1: A BROTH IS CONTROLLED. IT SIMMERS ON A STOVE. IT HAS SEASONING.
THE OCEAN? IT'S WILD, UNTAMED, AND FILLED WITH CREATURES THAT WOULD BITE YOUR FACE OFF IF YOU CALLED THEM DINNER.
Speaker 2: BUT ISN’T LIFE ITSELF JUST NATURE’S RECIPE UNFOLDING? EVOLUTION AS THE COOK, TIME AS THE SIMMERING HEAT, AND VOILÀ—YOU’VE GOT A BUBBLING CAULDRON OF MARINE BIODIVERSITY!
