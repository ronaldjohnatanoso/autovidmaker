There's one Bible verse that makes demons flee in terror. Want to know what it is? Even Satan himself can't stand to hear these words spoken with faith. It's Philippians 2, 10 to 11, and here's why it's so powerful.

At the name of Jesus, every knee shall bow. Every angel in heaven bows down, every person on earth will kneel, and every demon in hell is forced to bow. That name has absolute power over darkness. When you speak his name in faith, demons run. They have no choice but to submit. Say his name right now, Jesus.

Feel that power, that's why hell trembles. Type Amen if you felt his power, and subscribe for more truth that sets you free.
