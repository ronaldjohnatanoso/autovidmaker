voice_instruction: Extremely breathy, low-pitched male voice with soft throat resonance. British accent. Monotone and slow, like the speaker is drifting off. Whisper-dominant phonation with low larynx. Vocal cord tension minimal — breath carries most of the sound. Subtle subharmonic vibration layered into the airflow. Gentle vocal fry on fade-outs. Maximize breath-to-voice ratio, while preserving tactile low-end rumble inside the breath. Feels like an exhale with weight — intimate, calming, and sleep-inducing.
