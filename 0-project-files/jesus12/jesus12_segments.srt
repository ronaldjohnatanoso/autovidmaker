The disciples saw Jesus do this and completely freaked out. Even they couldn't believe it. They're fighting for their lives in a deadly storm. Then they see someone walking on the water. They screamed, it's a ghost. Jesus said, don't be afraid. It's me. Peter said, if that's you, let me walk too. And he did it. Peter walked on water. But then he looked at the storm and started sinking.
