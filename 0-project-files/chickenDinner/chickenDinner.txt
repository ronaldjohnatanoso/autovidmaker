voice_instruction: Calm, matter-of-fact. Like a motivational speaker, but hollow — like you’ve seen too much and care too little. Smiling, but dead in the eyes.

Speaker 1:

<p1 image_prompt="kitchen with a frozen chicken on the counter, phone screen showing 'Mom: 5 mins away'">So, you forgot to take the chicken out of the freezer. Again. And now, Mom's five minutes away. Congratulations, you're about to experience the culinary equivalent of a horror movie.</p1>

<p2 image_prompt="close-up of frozen chicken with frost, alarm clock showing 4:55 PM">That chicken? It's still frozen solid. Like your sense of responsibility. You had one job. One. And you failed. Spectacularly.</p2>

<p3 image_prompt="gaming setup with 'Winner Winner Chicken Dinner' on screen, chicken still in freezer">You were too busy chasing virtual chicken dinners to prepare the real one. Irony called; it wants its joke back.</p3>

<p4 image_prompt="browser history showing 'femboy streamers', chicken in freezer">Caught up in your digital escapades, huh? While you were immersed in your online fantasies, reality was defrosting your credibility.</p4>

<p5 image_prompt="belt hanging on wall, broom leaning nearby, ominous lighting">Better hide the belt. And the broom. They're not just cleaning tools anymore; they're instruments of justice in Mom's hands.</p5>

<p6 image_prompt="family photo with you looking disheveled, sibling with multiple awards">Remember when Mom said, 'Why can't you be more like your cousin?' Yeah, the one who graduated early and volunteers on weekends. You're not even in the same league.</p6>

<p7 image_prompt="text message from Mom: 'Did you take the chicken out?', unread">She even reminded you. Sent a text. But you left it on read. Bold move. Now face the consequences.</p7>

<p8 image_prompt="microwave with chicken inside, smoke coming out">Thinking of a quick fix? The microwave? Sure, if you want to serve rubbery disappointment seasoned with regret.</p8>

<p9 image_prompt="you holding chicken under hot water, panicked expression">Running it under hot water now? Desperation smells like salmonella. You're not cooking; you're cultivating bacteria.</p9>

<p10 image_prompt="door handle turning, Mom's silhouette visible through frosted glass">Hear that? It's the doorknob turning. The final countdown. Your last moments of peace before the storm.</p10>

<p11 image_prompt="Mom entering kitchen, eyes scanning, noticing frozen chicken">She sees it. The frozen bird. Her eyes narrow. The temperature drops further, and it's not because of the chicken.</p11>

<p12 image_prompt="you stammering, pointing at chicken, Mom unimpressed">You try to explain. Words fail. Excuses falter. She's heard them all before. You're not just grounded; you're marinated in disappointment.</p12>

<p13 image_prompt="calendar with 'Take out chicken' written on every day, all unchecked">This isn't the first time. It's a pattern. A lifestyle choice. Procrastination is your only consistent habit.</p13>

<p14 image_prompt="Mom texting family group chat, 'Guess who forgot the chicken again?'">Now, the family knows. Group chat notification: 'Guess who forgot the chicken again?' You're the punchline of every dinner table joke.</p14>

<p15 image_prompt="you sitting alone at dinner table, empty plate, others eating">Dinner is served. For everyone else. You? You're on a diet of shame and solitude. Bon appétit.</p15>

<p16 image_prompt="Mom handing you a list of chores, 'Since you have free time...'">She hands you a list. Chores. Since you have so much free time. Consider it a menu of penance.</p16>

<p17 image_prompt="you scrubbing floors, chicken still in freezer, mocking you">As you scrub the floors, the chicken remains in the freezer, mocking you with its icy silence. It's the only thing colder than Mom's glare.</p17>

<p18 image_prompt="alarm clock set to 3 PM, sticky note: 'Take out chicken'">Set an alarm next time? You did. Snoozed it. Priorities: sleep over survival. Bold strategy.</p18>

<p19 image_prompt="mirror reflecting you in apron, holding cookbook, determined expression">Maybe it's time to learn. Cook. Clean. Adult. Or at least pretend convincingly. Survival depends on it.</p19>

<p20 image_prompt="you placing chicken in fridge, proud smile, Mom entering, surprised">Next day. You take the chicken out early. Place it in the fridge. Mom enters, surprised. Progress. Minor, but noted.</p20>

<p21 image_prompt="Mom smiling slightly, handing you apron, 'You're cooking tonight.'">She smiles. Slightly. Hands you an apron. 'You're cooking tonight.' Redemption? Or another test? Only time will tell.</p21>

<p22 image_prompt="you cooking, smoke alarm going off, Mom laughing">You cook. Smoke alarm blares. Mom laughs. Not at you, but with you. Maybe. Progress is a series of small fires.</p22>

<p23 image_prompt="dinner served, everyone eating, you smiling">Dinner is served. Edible. Everyone eats. You smile. Victory tastes like slightly overcooked chicken.</p23>

<p24 image_prompt="Mom patting your back, 'Not bad.'">She pats your back. 'Not bad.' High praise. You've moved from disappointment to acceptable. A promotion.</p24>

<p25 image_prompt="you setting alarm, sticky note: 'Take out chicken'">You set an alarm. Place a sticky note. 'Take out chicken.' Growth. Responsibility. Or fear. Either way, it works.</p25>
