Calm, matter-of-fact. Like a motivational speaker, but hollow — like you’ve seen too much and care too little. Smiling, but dead in the eyes.
Speaker 1: 
So, you forgot to take the chicken out of the freezer. Again. And now, Mom's five minutes away. Congratulations, you're about to experience the culinary equivalent of a horror movie.
That chicken? It's still frozen solid. Like your sense of responsibility. You had one job. One. And you failed. Spectacularly.
You were too busy chasing virtual chicken dinners to prepare the real one. Irony called; it wants its joke back.
Caught up in your digital escapades, huh? While you were immersed in your online fantasies, reality was defrosting your credibility.
Better hide the belt. And the broom. They're not just cleaning tools anymore; they're instruments of justice in Mom's hands.
Remember when Mom said, 'Why can't you be more like your cousin?' Yeah, the one who graduated early and volunteers on weekends. You're not even in the same league.
She even reminded you. Sent a text. But you left it on read. Bold move. Now face the consequences.
Thinking of a quick fix? The microwave? Sure, if you want to serve rubbery disappointment seasoned with regret.
Running it under hot water now? Desperation smells like salmonella. You're not cooking; you're cultivating bacteria.
Hear that? It's the doorknob turning. The final countdown. Your last moments of peace before the storm.
She sees it. The frozen bird. Her eyes narrow. The temperature drops further, and it's not because of the chicken.
You try to explain. Words fail. Excuses falter. She's heard them all before. You're not just grounded; you're marinated in disappointment.
This isn't the first time. It's a pattern. A lifestyle choice. Procrastination is your only consistent habit.
Now, the family knows. Group chat notification: 'Guess who forgot the chicken again?' You're the punchline of every dinner table joke.
Dinner is served. For everyone else. You? You're on a diet of shame and solitude. Bon appétit.
She hands you a list. Chores. Since you have so much free time. Consider it a menu of penance.
As you scrub the floors, the chicken remains in the freezer, mocking you with its icy silence. It's the only thing colder than Mom's glare.
Set an alarm next time? You did. Snoozed it. Priorities: sleep over survival. Bold strategy.
Maybe it's time to learn. Cook. Clean. Adult. Or at least pretend convincingly. Survival depends on it.
Next day. You take the chicken out early. Place it in the fridge. Mom enters, surprised. Progress. Minor, but noted.
She smiles. Slightly. Hands you an apron. 'You're cooking tonight.' Redemption? Or another test? Only time will tell.
You cook. Smoke alarm blares. Mom laughs. Not at you, but with you. Maybe. Progress is a series of small fires.
Dinner is served. Edible. Everyone eats. You smile. Victory tastes like slightly overcooked chicken.
She pats your back. 'Not bad.' High praise. You've moved from disappointment to acceptable. A promotion.
You set an alarm. Place a sticky note. 'Take out chicken.' Growth. Responsibility. Or fear. Either way, it works.
