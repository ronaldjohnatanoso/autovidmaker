You'll

Overrated!

You

80
00:00:37,728 --> 00:00:37,968
were

You

91
00:00:42,716 --> 00:00:42,996

97
00:00:45,118 --> 00:00:45,320
You

98
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:45,600
just

99
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:45,859

00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:47,523
quiet

105
00:00:47,523 --> 00:00:47,823
enough

106
00:00:47,823 --> 00:00:47,984

00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:49,326
peace.

110
00:00:49,847 --> 00:00:50,246
That's

111
00:00:50,246 --> 00:00:51,048
self-care

112
00:00:51,048 --> 00:00:51,853

113
00:00:51,853 --> 00:00:52,255
Look

00:00:52,515 --> 00:00:53,295
mirror.

117
00:00:53,295 --> 00:00:53,576
That's

118
00:00:53,576 --> 00:00:53,756
not

119
00:00:53,756 --> 00:00:54,137

00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:57,643
stare?

127
00:00:57,643 --> 00:00:58,344
That's

128
00:00:58,344 --> 00:00:58,625
your

129
00:00:58,625 --> 00:00:59,106

131
00:01:00,107 --> 00:01:00,628
Cherish

132
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:00,908

133
00:01:00,908 --> 00:01:02,351
Every

134
00:01:02,351 --> 00:01:02,692

135
00:01:02,692 --> 00:01:02,953
you

136
00:01:02,953 --> 00:01:03,414
try,

137
00:01:03,414 --> 00:01:03,694
the

138
00:01:03,694 --> 00:01:04,254

139
00:01:04,254 --> 00:01:05,677
slow-claps.

140
00:01:05,677 --> 00:01:05,918
Not

141
00:01:05,918 --> 00:01:06,058

142
00:01:06,058 --> 00:01:06,138

143
00:01:06,138 --> 00:01:07,379
sarcasm,

144
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:07,540
out

145
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:07,721
of

146
00:01:07,721 --> 00:01:08,141
pity.

147
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:08,882
It's

148
00:01:08,882 --> 00:01:09,683
adorable

149
00:01:09,683 --> 00:01:10,105
watching

150
00:01:10,105 --> 00:01:10,284

153
00:01:11,486 --> 00:01:12,028
matters.

154
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:12,969
The

155
00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:13,490

00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:13,971
doesn't

00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:14,873
care.

158
00:01:14,873 --> 00:01:15,052
Not

159
00:01:15,052 --> 00:01:15,394
because

160
00:01:15,394 --> 00:01:15,674
it's

161
00:01:15,674 --> 00:01:16,475
cruel,

162
00:01:16,475 --> 00:01:16,656
but

163
00:01:16,656 --> 00:01:17,057
because

164
00:01:17,057 --> 00:01:17,296
it's

165
00:01:17,296 --> 00:01:18,094
busy.

166
00:01:18,094 --> 00:01:18,355
It's

00:01:25,165 --> 00:01:26,025
Honestly,

00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:43,829
Right

217
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:44,109
now,

218
00:01:44,691 --> 00:01:45,091
reading

219
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:45,451
me.

220
00:01:46,057 --> 00:01:46,858
Motivation

221
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:47,218
is

222
00:01:47,218 --> 00:01:47,317
a

223
00:01:47,317 --> 00:01:48,319
scam.

224
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:48,819
Hope

225
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:49,000
is

226
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,100
a

227
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,001

228
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:50,903
service.

229
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:51,063
You

230
00:01:51,063 --> 00:01:51,322
missed

231
00:01:51,322 --> 00:01:51,483
the

232
00:01:51,483 --> 00:01:51,823

234
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:52,765
and

235
00:01:52,765 --> 00:01:52,905
the

236
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:53,445

238
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:54,427
closed

239
00:01:54,427 --> 00:01:54,606
in

240
00:01:54,606 --> 00:01:55,308
childhood.

241
00:01:56,088 --> 00:01:56,429
Whenever

242
00:01:56,429 --> 00:01:56,649
you

243
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:56,950
try

244
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,129
to

245
00:01:57,129 --> 00:01:57,469
better

246
00:01:57,469 --> 00:01:58,271
yourself,

247
00:01:58,271 --> 00:01:59,052
remember,

248
00:01:59,052 --> 00:01:59,391
there's

249
00:01:59,391 --> 00:01:59,492
a

250
00:01:59,492 --> 00:01:59,992
comment

251
00:01:59,992 --> 00:02:00,474
section

252
00:02:00,474 --> 00:02:00,634
out

253
00:02:00,634 --> 00:02:00,894
there

254
00:02:00,894 --> 00:02:01,655
laughing

255
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:02,094
before

256
00:02:02,094 --> 00:02:02,415
you

257
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:02,715
even

258
00:02:02,715 --> 00:02:03,156
hit

259
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:03,656
upload.

260
00:02:04,378 --> 00:02:04,838
People

261
00:02:04,838 --> 00:02:05,239
love

262
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:05,338
a

263
00:02:05,338 --> 00:02:05,879
success

264
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:06,700
story

265
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,100
until

266
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:07,320
it's

267
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,242
yours.

268
00:02:08,242 --> 00:02:08,483
Then

269
00:02:08,483 --> 00:02:09,123
it's

270
00:02:09,123 --> 00:02:09,604
cringe.

271
00:02:10,224 --> 00:02:10,504
Try

272
00:02:10,504 --> 00:02:10,625
to

273
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:10,906
win?

274
00:02:10,906 --> 00:02:11,485
They'll

275
00:02:11,485 --> 00:02:11,766
call

276
00:02:11,766 --> 00:02:11,866
it

277
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:11,967
a

278
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:12,848
phase.

279
00:02:12,848 --> 00:02:13,649
Lose?

280
00:02:13,649 --> 00:02:13,989
Told

281
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:14,209
you

282
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:15,165
so.

283
00:02:15,165 --> 00:02:15,485
They

284
00:02:15,485 --> 00:02:15,887
told

285
00:02:15,887 --> 00:02:16,106
you

286
00:02:16,106 --> 00:02:16,287
you

287
00:02:16,287 --> 00:02:16,507
could

288
00:02:16,507 --> 00:02:16,927
be

289
00:02:16,927 --> 00:02:17,729
anything.

290
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:17,949
They

291
00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:18,229
just

292
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:18,550
didn't

293
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:18,830
tell

294
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:19,030
you

295
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,510
no

296
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:19,670
one

297
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:19,950
would

298
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:20,330
care

299
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:20,771
once

300
00:02:20,771 --> 00:02:21,032
you

301
00:02:21,032 --> 00:02:21,492
tried.

302
00:02:22,073 --> 00:02:22,193
Or

303
00:02:22,193 --> 00:02:22,413
that

304
00:02:22,413 --> 00:02:22,574
the

305
00:02:22,574 --> 00:02:22,933
world

306
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:23,153
would

307
00:02:23,153 --> 00:02:23,375
ask

308
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:23,514
you

309
00:02:23,514 --> 00:02:23,634
to

310
00:02:23,634 --> 00:02:23,835
do

311
00:02:23,835 --> 00:02:24,094
it

312
00:02:24,094 --> 00:02:24,716
unpaid.

313
00:02:25,356 --> 00:02:25,516
So

314
00:02:25,516 --> 00:02:26,177
yeah,

315
00:02:26,177 --> 00:02:26,457
give

316
00:02:26,457 --> 00:02:27,018
up.

317
00:02:27,018 --> 00:02:27,218
It's

318
00:02:27,218 --> 00:02:27,658
cheaper.

319
00:02:27,658 --> 00:02:28,159
It's

320
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:29,061
quieter.

321
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:29,181
And

322
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:29,461
best

323
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:29,621
of

324
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:30,122
all,

325
00:02:30,122 --> 00:02:30,361
no

326
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:30,481
one

327
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:30,801
will

328
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:31,043
ask

329
00:02:31,043 --> 00:02:31,223
you

330
00:02:31,223 --> 00:02:31,582
how

331
00:02:31,582 --> 00:02:31,883
your

332
00:02:31,883 --> 00:02:32,604
project

333
00:02:32,604 --> 00:02:32,743
is

334
00:02:32,743 --> 00:02:33,585
going.

335
00:02:33,585 --> 00:02:33,885
Ever

336
00:02:33,885 --> 00:02:34,225
again.

337
00:02:34,225 --> 00:02:35,387
Or,

338
00:02:35,387 --> 00:02:35,647
better

339
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:36,268
yet,

340
00:02:36,268 --> 00:02:36,587
keep

341
00:02:36,587 --> 00:02:37,368
going.

342
00:02:37,368 --> 00:02:37,590
For

343
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:37,870
no

344
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,751
reason.

345
00:02:38,751 --> 00:02:38,911
In

346
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:39,431
spite

347
00:02:39,431 --> 00:02:39,671
of

348
00:02:39,671 --> 00:02:40,432
nothing.

349
00:02:40,432 --> 00:02:40,673
Just

350
00:02:40,673 --> 00:02:40,812
to

351
00:02:40,812 --> 00:02:41,433
confuse

352
00:02:41,433 --> 00:02:42,093
them.

353
00:02:42,093 --> 00:02:42,234
A

354
00:02:42,234 --> 00:02:42,754
silent

355
00:02:42,754 --> 00:02:43,415
protest

356
00:02:43,415 --> 00:02:43,756
called

357
00:02:43,756 --> 00:02:45,034
existing.

358
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:45,415
until

359
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:45,515
it

360
00:02:45,515 --> 00:02:45,915
stops

361
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:46,276
being

362
00:02:46,276 --> 00:02:46,576
funny.

363
00:02:47,277 --> 00:02:47,679
Because

364
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:48,098
here's

365
00:02:48,098 --> 00:02:48,299
the

366
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:48,979
punchline.

367
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:49,640
It

368
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,002
never

369
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:50,923
mattered.

370
00:02:50,923 --> 00:02:51,122
Not

371
00:02:51,122 --> 00:02:51,282
what

372
00:02:51,282 --> 00:02:51,484
you

373
00:02:51,484 --> 00:02:52,123
did,

374
00:02:52,123 --> 00:02:52,405
not

375
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:52,585
what

376
00:02:52,585 --> 00:02:52,764
you

377
00:02:52,764 --> 00:02:53,485
didn't.

378
00:02:53,485 --> 00:02:53,747
You've

379
00:02:53,747 --> 00:02:54,086
already

380
00:02:54,086 --> 00:02:54,326
been

381
00:02:54,326 --> 00:02:55,008
forgotten

382
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:55,169
by

383
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:55,709
people

384
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:56,110
still

385
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:56,550
alive.

386
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:57,512
And

387
00:02:57,512 --> 00:02:58,212
yet,

388
00:02:58,212 --> 00:02:58,473
you're

389
00:02:58,473 --> 00:02:58,793
still

390
00:02:58,793 --> 00:02:59,133
here.

391
00:02:59,133 --> 00:02:59,814
That's

392
00:02:59,814 --> 00:03:00,034
not

393
00:03:00,034 --> 00:03:01,015
resilience.

394
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:01,257
That's

395
00:03:01,257 --> 00:03:02,578
inertia.

396
00:03:02,578 --> 00:03:02,818
Good

397
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:02,998
for

398
00:03:02,998 --> 00:03:03,218
you,

399
00:03:03,218 --> 00:03:03,840
Boulder.

400
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:04,820
So

401
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,062
go

402
00:03:05,062 --> 00:03:05,703
ahead.

403
00:03:05,703 --> 00:03:05,962
Try

404
00:03:05,962 --> 00:03:06,263
again

405
00:03:06,263 --> 00:03:06,864
tomorrow.

406
00:03:07,365 --> 00:03:07,504
Or

407
00:03:07,504 --> 00:03:07,844
don't.

408
00:03:08,366 --> 00:03:08,626
Either

409
00:03:08,626 --> 00:03:09,167
way,

410
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:09,326
the

411
00:03:09,326 --> 00:03:09,687
world

412
00:03:09,687 --> 00:03:09,907
will

413
00:03:09,907 --> 00:03:10,188
keep

414
00:03:10,188 --> 00:03:10,949
spinning,

415
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:11,110
and

416
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,509
you'll

417
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:11,770
keep

418
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:12,371
pretending

419
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:12,852
not

420
00:03:12,852 --> 00:03:13,051
to

421
00:03:13,051 --> 00:03:13,573
notice.
