You'll

32
00:00:16,495 --> 00:00:16,817

33
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:17,176

Overrated.

90
00:00:48,112 --> 00:00:48,271
You

91
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:48,432
don't

92
00:00:48,432 --> 00:00:48,631
need

93
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:48,871

97
00:00:50,521 --> 00:00:50,801
You

98
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:51,000
just

99
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,201
need

100
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:51,322

104
00:00:52,603 --> 00:00:53,063
quiet

105
00:00:53,063 --> 00:00:53,423
enough

106
00:00:53,423 --> 00:00:53,683

00:00:54,965 --> 00:00:55,344
peace.

110
00:00:56,106 --> 00:00:56,386
That's

111
00:00:56,386 --> 00:00:57,167
self-care

112
00:00:57,167 --> 00:00:57,347
now.

113
00:00:58,307 --> 00:00:58,527
Look

114
00:00:58,527 --> 00:00:58,607
in

115
00:00:58,607 --> 00:00:58,728
the

116
00:00:58,728 --> 00:00:59,067
mirror.

117
00:00:59,588 --> 00:00:59,848
That's

118
00:00:59,848 --> 00:01:00,029
not

119
00:01:00,029 --> 00:01:00,409
your

120
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:00,770
enemy.

121
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:01,631
That's

122
00:01:01,631 --> 00:01:02,170
your

123
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:02,610
audience.

124
00:01:03,451 --> 00:01:03,692
That

125
00:01:03,692 --> 00:01:04,033
blank

126
00:01:04,033 --> 00:01:04,373
stare.

127
00:01:04,893 --> 00:01:05,134
That's

128
00:01:05,134 --> 00:01:05,313
your

129
00:01:05,313 --> 00:01:05,733
biggest

130
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:06,134
fan.

131
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:07,456
Cherish

132
00:01:07,456 --> 00:01:07,736
them.

133
00:01:07,736 --> 00:01:08,897
The

134
00:01:08,897 --> 00:01:09,656
world

135
00:01:09,656 --> 00:01:10,097
doesn't

136
00:01:10,097 --> 00:01:10,397
care.

137
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:11,239
Not

138
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:11,638
because

139
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:11,959
it's

140
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:12,420
cruel,

141
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,180
but

142
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:13,721
because

143
00:01:13,721 --> 00:01:14,001
it's

144
00:01:14,001 --> 00:01:14,882
busy.

145
00:01:14,882 --> 00:01:15,042
It's

146
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:15,341
got

147
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:15,862

00:01:17,123 --> 00:01:17,805
ignoring

152
00:01:17,805 --> 00:01:18,224
their

153
00:01:18,224 --> 00:01:19,105
potential,

154
00:01:19,105 --> 00:01:19,566
too.

155
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:20,850

158
00:01:21,932 --> 00:01:22,253
don't.

159
00:01:22,993 --> 00:01:23,555
Honestly,

160
00:01:24,156 --> 00:01:24,415

163
00:01:25,737 --> 00:01:25,938
You

164
00:01:25,938 --> 00:01:26,198
can

165
00:01:26,198 --> 00:01:26,679
fail

166
00:01:26,679 --> 00:01:27,299
quietly

167
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:27,840

Freedom,

00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:33,509
All

178
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:33,730

187
00:01:38,656 --> 00:01:39,537
realizing

188
00:01:39,537 --> 00:01:39,798
this

189
00:01:39,798 --> 00:01:40,019
is

190
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:40,579
it.

191
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:40,900
This

192
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,040
is

193
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,219
the

194
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:42,042
peak

195
00:01:42,042 --> 00:01:42,402
right

196
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:43,082

So

203
00:01:46,989 --> 00:01:47,188
It's

204
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:47,947
cheaper.

205
00:01:47,947 --> 00:01:48,308
It's

206
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:48,870
quieter,

207
00:01:49,393 --> 00:01:49,552
and

208
00:01:49,552 --> 00:01:49,875
