Hey, you. Yeah, you. Thinking of trying? Don't. Sit down. Let's save us both some time. You're not gonna write that book, or start that business, or fix your life. You'll think about it, and then scroll, and then sleep. Congrats! You've already peaked. Self-improvement is a treadmill with better lighting. You run, you sweat, you end up in the same place. Just more tired and slightly more hydrated.

Hard work, overrated, luck runs this place. And you, you were born a background character in someone else's highlight reel. You don't need to find your passion, you just need to find a corner quiet enough to decay in peace. That's self-care now.
