Hey, you! Yeah, you! Thinking of trying? Don't. Sit down. Let's save us both some time. You're not gonna write that book, or start that business, or fix your life. You'll think about it, and then scroll, and then sleep. Congrats. You've already peaked.

Self-improvement is a treadmill with better lighting. You run, you sweat, you end up in the same place. Just more tired and slightly more hydrated. Hard work? Overrated. Luck runs this place. And you? You were born a background character in someone else's highlight reel. You don't need to find your passion.

You just need to find a corner quiet enough to decay in peace. That's self-care now. Look in the mirror. That's not your enemy. That's your audience. That blank stare. That's your biggest fan. Cherish them. The world doesn't care. Not because it's cruel, but because it's busy. It's got seven billion other people ignoring their potential, too.

dream big or don't. Honestly, no one's watching. You can fail quietly and no one will update your Wikipedia page. Freedom, right? All those inspirational quotes lies a coping mechanism for people realizing this is it. This is the peak right now reading me. So yeah, give up. It's cheaper.

It's quieter, and best of all, no one will ask you how your project is going, ever again.
