voice_instruction: Calm, matter-of-fact. Like a motivational speaker, but hollow — like you’ve seen too much and care too little. Smiling, but dead in the eyes.

Speaker 1:

<p1 image_prompt="abandoned stage with a single spotlight on a broken podium, audience chairs empty">Hey. You. Yeah, you. Thinking of trying? Don’t. Sit down. Let’s save us both some time.</p1>

<p2 image_prompt="calendar where every day is marked 'maybe tomorrow'">You’re not gonna write that book. Or start that business. Or fix your life. You’ll think about it. And then scroll. And then sleep. Congrats. You’ve already peaked.</p2>

<p3 image_prompt="man jogging in fog but treadmill is on fire">Self-improvement is a treadmill with better lighting. You run. You sweat. You end up in the same place. Just more tired and slightly more hydrated.</p3>

<p4 image_prompt="diploma in trash can next to unpaid bills and a to-do list that says 'scream'">Hard work? Overrated. Luck runs this place. And you? You were born a background character in someone else's highlight reel.</p4>

<p5 image_prompt="trophy labeled 'Participation in Existence' cracked and covered in dust">You don’t need to find your passion. You just need to find a corner quiet enough to decay in peace. That’s self-care now.</p5>

<p6 image_prompt="mirror showing nothing but static instead of a reflection">Look in the mirror. That’s not your enemy. That’s your audience. That blank stare? That’s your biggest fan. Cherish them.</p6>

<p7 image_prompt="giant boulder labeled 'life' rolling down hill toward tiny person napping">The world doesn’t care. Not because it’s cruel. But because it’s busy. It's got seven billion other people ignoring their potential, too.</p7>

<p8 image_prompt="motivation poster that just says 'meh.'">Dream big. Or don’t. Honestly, no one’s watching. You can fail quietly and no one will update your Wikipedia page. Freedom, right?</p8>

<p9 image_prompt="person drowning in motivational sticky notes like 'you got this!' and 'grind harder!'">All those inspirational quotes? Lies. A coping mechanism for people realizing this is it. This is the peak. Right now. Reading me.</p9>

<p10 image_prompt="exit sign flickering in an empty room">So yeah… give up. It's cheaper. It's quieter. And best of all? No one will ask you how your ‘project’ is going. Ever again.</p10>
