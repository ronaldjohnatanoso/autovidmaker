Speaker 1:

<p1 image_prompt="abandoned stage with broken podium under a spotlight, plastic folding chairs knocked over, one with 'reserved for greatness' sign hanging loosely">Hey. You. Yeah, you. Thinking of trying? Don’t. Sit down. Let’s save us both some time.</p1>

<p2 image_prompt="calendar where every single day is labeled 'maybe tomorrow', post-its covering the dates like mold">You’re not gonna write that book. Or start that business. Or fix your life. You’ll think about it. And then scroll. And then sleep. Congrats. You’ve already peaked.</p2>

<p3 image_prompt="a man jogging in heavy fog on a burning treadmill, motivational banner behind him says 'you got this' melting in the flames">Self-improvement is a treadmill with better lighting. You run. You sweat. You end up in the same place. Just more tired and slightly more hydrated.</p3>

<p4 image_prompt="crumpled diploma in overflowing trash can next to bills marked 'final notice' and a sticky note that says 'scream' in shaky handwriting">Hard work? Overrated. Luck runs this place. And you? You were born a background character in someone else's highlight reel.</p4>

<p5 image_prompt="trophy labeled 'Participation in Existence' cracked and covered in dust, a crowd in the background laughing and taking selfies">You don’t need to find your passion. You just need to find a corner quiet enough to decay in peace. That’s self-care now.</p5>

<p6 image_prompt="bathroom mirror reflecting only static and noise, with 'try again tomorrow' written in toothpaste">Look in the mirror. That’s not your enemy. That’s your audience. That blank stare? That’s your biggest fan. Cherish them.</p6>

<p7 image_prompt="a group of coworkers laughing at a person giving a presentation, slide says 'my goals', another slide says 'who cares lol'">Every time you try, the universe slow claps. Not out of sarcasm. Out of pity. It’s adorable watching you pretend effort matters.</p7>

<p8 image_prompt="a giant boulder labeled 'life' rolling downhill toward a sleeping person in a motivational shirt that says 'grind harder'">The world doesn’t care. Not because it’s cruel. But because it’s busy. It's got seven billion other people ignoring their potential, too.</p8>

<p9 image_prompt="classic motivation poster ripped in half, replaced with handwritten note that says 'give up already'">Dream big. Or don’t. Honestly, no one’s watching. You can fail quietly and no one will update your Wikipedia page. Freedom, right?</p9>

<p10 image_prompt="person underwater, drowning in sticky notes that say 'you got this', 'be the change', and 'rise and grind', bubbles escaping from mouth like laughter">All those inspirational quotes? Lies. A coping mechanism for people realizing this is it. This is the peak. Right now. Reading me.</p10>

<p11 image_prompt="empty auditorium where one person is giving a speech to mannequins, all turned away, projector screen says 'follow your dreams (lol)'">Motivation is a scam. Hope is a subscription service. You missed the free trial. And the refund window closed in childhood.</p11>

<p12 image_prompt="social media app on screen showing post: 'i'm trying', flooded with laughing emojis and comments saying 'bro thinks he matters'">Whenever you try to better yourself, remember: there's a comment section out there laughing before you even hit upload.</p12>

<p13 image_prompt="a person climbing a mountain made of resumes, self-help books, and tears, crowd at the bottom pointing and laughing">People love a success story. Until it's yours. Then it's cringe. Try to win? They’ll call it a phase. Lose? Told you so.</p13>

<p14 image_prompt="younger version of speaker in graduation cap photoshopped into a trash can, confetti around, banner above says 'Reality Welcomes You!'">They told you you could be anything. They just didn’t tell you no one would care once you tried. Or that the world would ask you to do it unpaid.</p14>

<p15 image_prompt="exit sign flickering in an empty hallway, under it a carpet that reads 'keep going!' with blood stains on it">So yeah… give up. It’s cheaper. It’s quieter. And best of all? No one will ask you how your 'project' is going. Ever again.</p15>

<p16 image_prompt="a person standing in spotlight alone, cardboard cutout crowd behind them, audio speakers playing canned applause, slowly warping">Or better yet—keep going. For no reason. In spite of nothing. Just to confuse them. A silent protest called existing. Until it stops being funny.</p16>

<p17 image_prompt="close-up of face smiling at camera with tear in eye and text overlaid: 'why do we even try?' with a laughing emoji">Because here’s the punchline: it never mattered. Not what you do. Not what you didn’t. You’ve already been forgotten by people still alive.</p17>

<p18 image_prompt="person at birthday party alone, clapping for themselves, cake says 'Nice Try, I Guess.'">And yet… you’re still here. That’s not resilience. That’s inertia. Good for you, boulder.</p18>

<p19 image_prompt="final image: empty space. a chair. a mic. spotlight still on. no one left">So go ahead. Try again tomorrow. Or don’t. Either way, the world will keep spinning. And you’ll keep pretending not to notice.</p19>
