Speaker 1:

<p1 image_prompt="abandoned stage with broken podium under a spotlight, plastic folding chairs knocked over, one with 'reserved for greatness' sign hanging loosely">Hey. You. Yeah, you. Thinking of trying? Don’t. Sit down. Let’s save us both some time.</p1>

<p2 image_prompt="calendar where every single day is labeled 'maybe tomorrow', post-its covering the dates like mold">You’re not gonna write that book. Or start that business. Or fix your life. You’ll think about it. And then scroll. And then sleep. Congrats. You’ve already peaked.</p2>

<p3 image_prompt="a man jogging in heavy fog on a burning treadmill, motivational banner behind him says 'you got this' melting in the flames">Self-improvement is a treadmill with better lighting. You run. You sweat. You end up in the same place. Just more tired and slightly more hydrated.</p3>

<p4 image_prompt="crumpled diploma in overflowing trash can next to bills marked 'final notice' and a sticky note that says 'scream' in shaky handwriting">Hard work? Overrated. Luck runs this place. And you? You were born a background character in someone else's highlight reel.</p4>

<p5 image_prompt="trophy labeled 'Participation in Existence' cracked and covered in dust, a crowd in the background laughing and taking selfies">You don’t need to find your passion. You just need to find a corner quiet enough to decay in peace. That’s self-care now.</p5>
