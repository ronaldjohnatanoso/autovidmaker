Read this with eagerness like a motivational speaker.
Speaker 1: 
Hey. You. Yeah, you. Thinking of trying? Don’t. Sit down. Let’s save us both some time.
You’re not gonna write that book. Or start that business. Or fix your life. You’ll think about it. And then scroll. And then sleep. Congrats. You’ve already peaked.
Self-improvement is a treadmill with better lighting. You run. You sweat. You end up in the same place. Just more tired and slightly more hydrated.
Hard work? Overrated. Luck runs this place. And you? You were born a background character in someone else's highlight reel.
You don’t need to find your passion. You just need to find a corner quiet enough to decay in peace. That’s self-care now.
Look in the mirror. That’s not your enemy. That’s your audience. That blank stare? That’s your biggest fan. Cherish them.
Every time you try, the universe slow claps. Not out of sarcasm. Out of pity. It’s adorable watching you pretend effort matters.
The world doesn’t care. Not because it’s cruel. But because it’s busy. It's got seven billion other people ignoring their potential, too.
Dream big. Or don’t. Honestly, no one’s watching. You can fail quietly and no one will update your Wikipedia page. Freedom, right?
All those inspirational quotes? Lies. A coping mechanism for people realizing this is it. This is the peak. Right now. Reading me.
Motivation is a scam. Hope is a subscription service. You missed the free trial. And the refund window closed in childhood.
Whenever you try to better yourself, remember: there's a comment section out there laughing before you even hit upload.
People love a success story. Until it's yours. Then it's cringe. Try to win? They’ll call it a phase. Lose? Told you so.
They told you you could be anything. They just didn’t tell you no one would care once you tried. Or that the world would ask you to do it unpaid.
So yeah… give up. It’s cheaper. It’s quieter. And best of all? No one will ask you how your 'project' is going. Ever again.
Or better yet—keep going. For no reason. In spite of nothing. Just to confuse them. A silent protest called existing. Until it stops being funny.
Because here’s the punchline: it never mattered. Not what you do. Not what you didn’t. You’ve already been forgotten by people still alive.
And yet… you’re still here. That’s not resilience. That’s inertia. Good for you, boulder.
So go ahead. Try again tomorrow. Or don’t. Either way, the world will keep spinning. And you’ll keep pretending not to notice.
