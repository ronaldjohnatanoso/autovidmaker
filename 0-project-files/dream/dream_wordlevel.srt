1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:00,632
I

2
00:00:00,672 --> 00:00:00,872
think

3
00:00:00,932 --> 00:00:00,992
it

4
00:00:01,072 --> 00:00:01,211
was

5
00:00:01,231 --> 00:00:01,252
a

6
00:00:01,372 --> 00:00:01,733
dream,

7
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:02,834
but

8
00:00:02,894 --> 00:00:02,934
it

9
00:00:02,994 --> 00:00:03,213
didn't

10
00:00:03,314 --> 00:00:03,515
feel

11
00:00:03,575 --> 00:00:03,734
like

12
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:03,975
one.

13
00:00:04,836 --> 00:00:04,936
The

14
00:00:04,976 --> 00:00:05,176
bed

15
00:00:05,256 --> 00:00:05,536
wasn't

16
00:00:05,617 --> 00:00:05,676
on

17
00:00:05,737 --> 00:00:05,817
the

18
00:00:05,857 --> 00:00:06,137
floor.

19
00:00:06,738 --> 00:00:06,798
It

20
00:00:06,838 --> 00:00:06,939
was

21
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:07,259
above

22
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:07,658
water.

23
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:08,801
The

24
00:00:08,861 --> 00:00:09,180
ceiling

25
00:00:09,221 --> 00:00:09,480
watched

26
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:09,641
me

27
00:00:09,682 --> 00:00:10,002
sleep.

28
00:00:11,163 --> 00:00:11,303
There

29
00:00:11,362 --> 00:00:11,444
was

30
00:00:11,503 --> 00:00:11,523
a

31
00:00:11,564 --> 00:00:12,023
calendar.

32
00:00:12,964 --> 00:00:13,205
Every

33
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:13,486
day

34
00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:13,746
was

35
00:00:13,785 --> 00:00:14,246
today.

36
00:00:14,266 --> 00:00:15,208
The

37
00:00:15,268 --> 00:00:15,807
handwriting

38
00:00:15,887 --> 00:00:16,028
said

39
00:00:16,088 --> 00:00:16,129
it

40
00:00:16,169 --> 00:00:16,268
was

41
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:16,669
mine,

42
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:16,989
but

43
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:17,289
I've

44
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:17,570
never

45
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:17,931
written

46
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:18,170
like

47
00:00:18,231 --> 00:00:18,431
that.

48
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:19,411
It

49
00:00:19,512 --> 00:00:19,832
curled

50
00:00:19,893 --> 00:00:20,172
wrong.

51
00:00:21,414 --> 00:00:21,475
I

52
00:00:21,594 --> 00:00:21,815
tried

53
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:21,934
to

54
00:00:21,995 --> 00:00:22,274
leave.

55
00:00:22,315 --> 00:00:23,556
There

56
00:00:23,597 --> 00:00:23,696
was

57
00:00:23,716 --> 00:00:23,896
no

58
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:24,198
door.

59
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:25,259
Just

60
00:00:25,318 --> 00:00:25,338
a

61
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:26,460
frame.

62
00:00:26,557 --> 00:00:26,737
When

63
00:00:26,797 --> 00:00:26,818
I

64
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:27,178
stepped

65
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:27,458
through,

66
00:00:27,478 --> 00:00:27,498
I

67
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:28,400
came

68
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:28,681
back

69
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:28,841
in

70
00:00:28,922 --> 00:00:29,062
from

71
00:00:29,161 --> 00:00:29,461
above.

72
00:00:30,303 --> 00:00:30,344
I

73
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:30,484
was

74
00:00:30,504 --> 00:00:30,903
already

75
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:31,024
in

76
00:00:31,085 --> 00:00:31,144
the

77
00:00:31,184 --> 00:00:31,445
bed,

78
00:00:32,426 --> 00:00:32,887
sleeping.

79
00:00:32,948 --> 00:00:34,168
The

80
00:00:34,249 --> 00:00:34,630
coffee

81
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,151
whispered

82
00:00:35,271 --> 00:00:35,712
something

83
00:00:35,752 --> 00:00:36,633
in

84
00:00:36,673 --> 00:00:36,692
a

85
00:00:36,753 --> 00:00:37,054
voice

86
00:00:37,234 --> 00:00:37,274
I

87
00:00:37,334 --> 00:00:37,533
knew

88
00:00:37,573 --> 00:00:37,835
from

89
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:38,456
childhood

90
00:00:38,536 --> 00:00:39,036
nightmares.

91
00:00:39,997 --> 00:00:40,097
The

92
00:00:40,137 --> 00:00:40,478
steam

93
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:40,899
spelled

94
00:00:40,918 --> 00:00:41,280
words

95
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:41,420
I

96
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:41,841
forgot

97
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:42,021
as

98
00:00:42,081 --> 00:00:42,261
soon

99
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:42,362
as

100
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:42,481
I

101
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:42,762
looked

102
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:43,082
away.

103
00:00:43,103 --> 00:00:43,122
I

104
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:44,765
opened

105
00:00:44,804 --> 00:00:44,865
the

106
00:00:44,905 --> 00:00:45,345
closet.

107
00:00:45,365 --> 00:00:46,468
The

108
00:00:46,548 --> 00:00:46,828
coats

109
00:00:46,908 --> 00:00:47,048
were

110
00:00:47,168 --> 00:00:47,569
upside

111
00:00:47,628 --> 00:00:47,890
down,

112
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,152
hanging

113
00:00:49,512 --> 00:00:49,652
from

114
00:00:49,732 --> 00:00:50,173
sleeves,

115
00:00:51,034 --> 00:00:51,115
and

116
00:00:51,155 --> 00:00:51,255
they

117
00:00:51,295 --> 00:00:51,435
were

118
00:00:52,195 --> 00:00:52,616
breathing.

119
00:00:52,637 --> 00:00:52,656
I

120
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:53,959
think

121
00:00:53,999 --> 00:00:54,158
they

122
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:54,420
knew

123
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:54,479
I

124
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:54,740
was

125
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:55,401
watching.

126
00:00:56,292 --> 00:00:56,451
There

127
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:56,572
was

128
00:00:56,612 --> 00:00:56,652
a

129
00:00:56,713 --> 00:00:57,033
photo

130
00:00:57,093 --> 00:00:57,152
on

131
00:00:57,192 --> 00:00:57,253
the

132
00:00:57,314 --> 00:00:57,573
wall,

133
00:00:58,075 --> 00:00:58,094
a

134
00:00:58,155 --> 00:00:58,576
family,

135
00:00:59,296 --> 00:00:59,517
my

136
00:00:59,637 --> 00:01:00,018
family,

137
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:00,719
I

138
00:01:00,779 --> 00:01:01,039
think,

139
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:01,981
but

140
00:01:02,081 --> 00:01:02,201
my

141
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:02,561
face

142
00:01:02,642 --> 00:01:02,781
was

143
00:01:02,883 --> 00:01:03,063
just

144
00:01:03,122 --> 00:01:03,564
static.

145
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:04,805
Everyone

146
00:01:04,846 --> 00:01:05,006
else

147
00:01:05,085 --> 00:01:05,206
was

148
00:01:05,287 --> 00:01:05,746
pointing,

149
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:07,049
smiling

150
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:07,409
too

151
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:07,811
wide.

152
00:01:08,792 --> 00:01:08,831
I

153
00:01:08,891 --> 00:01:09,132
looked

154
00:01:09,192 --> 00:01:09,674
outside.

155
00:01:10,534 --> 00:01:10,635
The

156
00:01:10,674 --> 00:01:10,995
ground

157
00:01:11,055 --> 00:01:11,156
was

158
00:01:11,236 --> 00:01:11,617
sky.

159
00:01:12,537 --> 00:01:12,658
The

160
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:12,998
sky

161
00:01:13,058 --> 00:01:13,198
was

162
00:01:13,278 --> 00:01:13,560
dirt.

163
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:14,742
Trees

164
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:15,263
grew

165
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:15,582
down

166
00:01:15,683 --> 00:01:15,843
from

167
00:01:15,924 --> 00:01:15,983
it,

168
00:01:16,584 --> 00:01:16,745
like

169
00:01:16,825 --> 00:01:17,126
roots.

170
00:01:18,206 --> 00:01:18,287
One

171
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:18,367
of

172
00:01:18,427 --> 00:01:18,548
them

173
00:01:18,608 --> 00:01:18,867
waved

174
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:18,968
at

175
00:01:19,028 --> 00:01:19,149
me.

176
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:20,551
The

177
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:21,031
TV

178
00:01:21,091 --> 00:01:21,191
was

179
00:01:21,272 --> 00:01:21,513
stuck

180
00:01:21,612 --> 00:01:21,673
on

181
00:01:21,793 --> 00:01:21,893
one

182
00:01:21,972 --> 00:01:22,974
image.

183
00:01:23,055 --> 00:01:23,376
Me,

184
00:01:24,257 --> 00:01:24,757
screaming,

185
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:25,959
over

186
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:26,159
and

187
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:26,459
over.

188
00:01:27,361 --> 00:01:27,460
My

189
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,760
mouth

190
00:01:27,861 --> 00:01:28,221
moved,

191
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:28,441
but

192
00:01:28,481 --> 00:01:28,641
there

193
00:01:28,682 --> 00:01:28,781
was

194
00:01:28,861 --> 00:01:28,981
no

195
00:01:29,061 --> 00:01:29,403
sound.

196
00:01:30,164 --> 00:01:30,384
Just

197
00:01:30,483 --> 00:01:30,563
the

198
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:30,963
ticking

199
00:01:31,004 --> 00:01:31,045
of

200
00:01:31,084 --> 00:01:31,165
the

201
00:01:31,204 --> 00:01:31,504
house.

202
00:01:32,385 --> 00:01:32,465
The

203
00:01:32,506 --> 00:01:32,766
mirror

204
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:33,046
didn't

205
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:33,307
show

206
00:01:33,346 --> 00:01:33,447
me

207
00:01:33,507 --> 00:01:33,686
now.

208
00:01:34,487 --> 00:01:34,548
It

209
00:01:34,647 --> 00:01:34,868
showed

210
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:34,989
me

211
00:01:35,088 --> 00:01:35,149
as

212
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:35,248
a

213
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:35,689
child,

214
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:36,811
crying,

215
00:01:37,611 --> 00:01:37,971
mouthing

216
00:01:38,072 --> 00:01:38,432
something.

217
00:01:39,313 --> 00:01:39,352
I

218
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:39,713
pressed

219
00:01:39,774 --> 00:01:39,894
my

220
00:01:39,953 --> 00:01:40,153
hand

221
00:01:40,194 --> 00:01:40,274
to

222
00:01:40,313 --> 00:01:40,375
the

223
00:01:40,415 --> 00:01:40,795
glass,

224
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:41,475
and

225
00:01:41,516 --> 00:01:41,596
he

226
00:01:41,656 --> 00:01:42,075
screamed.

227
00:01:43,218 --> 00:01:43,278
I

228
00:01:43,358 --> 00:01:43,697
climbed

229
00:01:43,718 --> 00:01:43,798
the

230
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:44,218
stairs.

231
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:45,159
They

232
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:45,540
folded

233
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:45,700
up

234
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:45,900
like

235
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:46,301
paper

236
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:46,680
behind

237
00:01:46,721 --> 00:01:47,341
me.

238
00:01:47,643 --> 00:01:47,903
There

239
00:01:47,923 --> 00:01:48,043
were

240
00:01:48,123 --> 00:01:48,364
feet

241
00:01:48,424 --> 00:01:48,483
at

242
00:01:48,504 --> 00:01:48,584
the

243
00:01:48,644 --> 00:01:48,944
top,

244
00:01:49,646 --> 00:01:49,865
bare

245
00:01:49,926 --> 00:01:50,167
feet,

246
00:01:50,908 --> 00:01:51,028
but

247
00:01:51,048 --> 00:01:51,629
nobody's

248
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:52,790
just

249
00:01:53,772 --> 00:01:54,093
waiting.

250
00:01:55,254 --> 00:01:55,334
The

251
00:01:55,394 --> 00:01:55,734
fridge

252
00:01:56,396 --> 00:01:56,516
was

253
00:01:56,596 --> 00:01:56,777
full

254
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:56,856
of

255
00:01:56,936 --> 00:01:57,298
clocks.

256
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:58,259
No

257
00:01:58,358 --> 00:01:58,659
food,

258
00:01:59,400 --> 00:01:59,600
just

259
00:01:59,661 --> 00:01:59,981
time,

260
00:02:00,022 --> 00:02:01,123
arguing

261
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:01,304
with

262
00:02:01,364 --> 00:02:01,724
itself.

263
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:02,725
One

264
00:02:02,786 --> 00:02:03,006
ticked

265
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:03,566
backwards.

266
00:02:04,388 --> 00:02:04,427
I

267
00:02:04,468 --> 00:02:04,608
think

268
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:04,688
it

269
00:02:04,748 --> 00:02:04,828
was

270
00:02:04,888 --> 00:02:05,549
mine.

271
00:02:06,171 --> 00:02:06,352
There

272
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:06,492
was

273
00:02:06,512 --> 00:02:06,531
a

274
00:02:06,632 --> 00:02:06,813
book

275
00:02:06,873 --> 00:02:06,933
on

276
00:02:06,953 --> 00:02:07,033
the

277
00:02:07,072 --> 00:02:07,373
table,

278
00:02:08,213 --> 00:02:08,555
pages

279
00:02:08,634 --> 00:02:08,895
filled

280
00:02:08,955 --> 00:02:09,055
with

281
00:02:09,134 --> 00:02:09,515
photos,

282
00:02:10,437 --> 00:02:10,556
all

283
00:02:10,616 --> 00:02:10,657
of

284
00:02:10,717 --> 00:02:10,877
me

285
00:02:11,717 --> 00:02:12,139
sleeping

286
00:02:12,938 --> 00:02:13,080
from

287
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:13,520
angles

288
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:13,699
that

289
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:13,961
don't

290
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:14,420
exist.

291
00:02:15,282 --> 00:02:15,342
I

292
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:15,662
ran

293
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:16,683
down

294
00:02:16,723 --> 00:02:16,804
the

295
00:02:16,843 --> 00:02:17,063
hall,

296
00:02:17,764 --> 00:02:17,865
but

297
00:02:17,925 --> 00:02:17,944
I

298
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:18,125
had

299
00:02:18,164 --> 00:02:18,405
two

300
00:02:18,485 --> 00:02:18,906
shadows,

301
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:19,806
one

302
00:02:19,826 --> 00:02:19,947
that

303
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:20,247
moved

304
00:02:20,287 --> 00:02:20,548
late,

305
00:02:21,429 --> 00:02:21,528
one

306
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:21,688
that

307
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:22,150
smiled

308
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:22,469
without

309
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:22,530
a

310
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:22,889
face

311
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:23,191
when

312
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:23,290
I

313
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:23,531
didn't

314
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:23,751
look

315
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,192
directly

316
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:24,372
at

317
00:02:24,431 --> 00:02:24,491
it.

318
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:25,413
In

319
00:02:25,473 --> 00:02:25,592
my

320
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:25,933
room,

321
00:02:26,574 --> 00:02:26,875
someone

322
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:27,014
had

323
00:02:27,074 --> 00:02:27,294
drawn

324
00:02:27,354 --> 00:02:27,375
a

325
00:02:27,435 --> 00:02:27,675
door

326
00:02:27,716 --> 00:02:27,795
in

327
00:02:27,855 --> 00:02:28,295
crayon.

328
00:02:29,076 --> 00:02:29,116
It

329
00:02:29,157 --> 00:02:29,257
was

330
00:02:29,296 --> 00:02:29,617
slightly

331
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:29,937
open,

332
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:30,979
light

333
00:02:31,038 --> 00:02:31,340
spilled

334
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:31,740
out.

335
00:02:32,328 --> 00:02:32,487
It

336
00:02:32,568 --> 00:02:32,848
hummed

337
00:02:32,908 --> 00:02:33,049
like

338
00:02:33,128 --> 00:02:33,269
my

339
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:33,610
name,

340
00:02:34,151 --> 00:02:34,270
but

341
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:34,471
not

342
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:34,670
how

343
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:34,770
it

344
00:02:34,852 --> 00:02:35,051
should

345
00:02:35,132 --> 00:02:35,412
sound.

346
00:02:36,253 --> 00:02:36,394
There

347
00:02:36,433 --> 00:02:36,514
was

348
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:36,593
a

349
00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:36,955
cake.

350
00:02:37,795 --> 00:02:37,915
My

351
00:02:37,955 --> 00:02:38,396
birthday,

352
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:39,177
I

353
00:02:39,237 --> 00:02:39,497
think.

354
00:02:40,338 --> 00:02:40,500
Too

355
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:40,759
many

356
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,260
candles

357
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:42,502
melting

358
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:43,022
backward

359
00:02:43,743 --> 00:02:43,963
into

360
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:44,384
tiny

361
00:02:44,444 --> 00:02:44,725
wax

362
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:45,105
people.

363
00:02:45,747 --> 00:02:45,866
They

364
00:02:45,926 --> 00:02:46,046
all

365
00:02:46,106 --> 00:02:46,328
looked

366
00:02:46,388 --> 00:02:46,548
like

367
00:02:46,608 --> 00:02:46,747
me.

368
00:02:46,788 --> 00:02:48,229
Someone

369
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:48,390
was

370
00:02:48,471 --> 00:02:48,610
under

371
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:48,730
the

372
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:49,171
blanket.

373
00:02:49,192 --> 00:02:50,052
I

374
00:02:50,112 --> 00:02:50,312
pulled

375
00:02:50,373 --> 00:02:50,413
it

376
00:02:50,473 --> 00:02:50,753
back.

377
00:02:51,655 --> 00:02:52,056
Nothing,

378
00:02:52,817 --> 00:02:52,937
but

379
00:02:52,956 --> 00:02:53,056
the

380
00:02:53,116 --> 00:02:53,358
sheet

381
00:02:53,418 --> 00:02:53,677
stayed

382
00:02:53,698 --> 00:02:54,019
heavy.

383
00:02:54,058 --> 00:02:54,979
It

384
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:55,561
breathed

385
00:02:55,881 --> 00:02:56,001
when

386
00:02:56,062 --> 00:02:56,102
I

387
00:02:56,162 --> 00:02:56,481
touched

388
00:02:56,562 --> 00:02:57,103
it.

389
00:02:57,538 --> 00:02:57,658
I

390
00:02:57,739 --> 00:02:57,939
found

391
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,039
a

392
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,340
note,

393
00:02:59,221 --> 00:02:59,461
wake

394
00:02:59,622 --> 00:02:59,681
up,

395
00:03:00,543 --> 00:03:00,663
but

396
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:00,804
the

397
00:03:00,864 --> 00:03:01,123
letters

398
00:03:01,183 --> 00:03:01,324
were

399
00:03:01,383 --> 00:03:01,705
fading

400
00:03:01,745 --> 00:03:02,025
every

401
00:03:02,064 --> 00:03:02,265
time

402
00:03:02,286 --> 00:03:02,306
I

403
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:02,887
blinked

404
00:03:03,568 --> 00:03:03,848
until

405
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:04,168
only

406
00:03:04,207 --> 00:03:04,449
up

407
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:04,889
was

408
00:03:04,969 --> 00:03:05,250
left,

409
00:03:05,871 --> 00:03:05,971
and

410
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:06,211
then,

411
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,513
not

412
00:03:07,552 --> 00:03:07,712
even

413
00:03:07,734 --> 00:03:08,033
that.

414
00:03:09,115 --> 00:03:09,175
I

415
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:09,475
woke

416
00:03:09,616 --> 00:03:09,675
up,

417
00:03:10,516 --> 00:03:10,578
I

418
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:10,918
think,

419
00:03:11,679 --> 00:03:11,778
but

420
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:11,899
I

421
00:03:11,938 --> 00:03:12,039
was

422
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:12,340
still

423
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:12,419
in

424
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:12,539
the

425
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:12,820
bed,

426
00:03:13,722 --> 00:03:13,782
on

427
00:03:13,822 --> 00:03:13,921
the

428
00:03:13,942 --> 00:03:14,342
screen.

429
00:03:15,163 --> 00:03:15,204
I

430
00:03:15,283 --> 00:03:15,564
watched

431
00:03:15,664 --> 00:03:16,025
myself

432
00:03:16,145 --> 00:03:16,366
wake

433
00:03:16,485 --> 00:03:16,586
up,

434
00:03:17,347 --> 00:03:17,608
over

435
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:17,967
and

436
00:03:18,087 --> 00:03:18,288
over,

437
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:19,210
each

438
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:19,590
time,

439
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:20,611
more

440
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:21,012
wrong,

441
00:03:21,794 --> 00:03:22,014
less

442
00:03:22,054 --> 00:03:22,854
human.

443
00:03:23,492 --> 00:03:23,693
I

444
00:03:23,713 --> 00:03:23,894
saw

445
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:24,354
myself

446
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:24,514
in

447
00:03:24,555 --> 00:03:24,575
a

448
00:03:24,675 --> 00:03:24,997
puddle,

449
00:03:25,717 --> 00:03:25,899
not

450
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:26,158
here,

451
00:03:27,001 --> 00:03:27,342
somewhere

452
00:03:27,421 --> 00:03:27,603
else,

453
00:03:28,425 --> 00:03:28,846
sleeping,

454
00:03:29,687 --> 00:03:30,008
wired

455
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:30,229
up,

456
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:31,311
mouth

457
00:03:31,371 --> 00:03:31,632
sown

458
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:31,973
shut,

459
00:03:32,794 --> 00:03:32,935
but

460
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:33,135
my

461
00:03:33,355 --> 00:03:33,516
eyes,

462
00:03:33,556 --> 00:03:34,399
they

463
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:34,558
were

464
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:34,879
wide

465
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:35,882
open.

466
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:36,294
And

467
00:03:36,314 --> 00:03:36,435
then

468
00:03:36,495 --> 00:03:36,556
I

469
00:03:36,596 --> 00:03:36,776
found

470
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:36,876
the

471
00:03:36,915 --> 00:03:37,156
room,

472
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:38,198
full

473
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:38,277
of

474
00:03:38,298 --> 00:03:38,617
beds,

475
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:39,658
full

476
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:39,739
of

477
00:03:39,818 --> 00:03:39,979
me,

478
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,121
every

479
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:41,401
bed,

480
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:42,522
another

481
00:03:42,582 --> 00:03:42,763
me,

482
00:03:42,802 --> 00:03:43,843
all

483
00:03:43,903 --> 00:03:44,365
whispering

484
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:44,465
at

485
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:44,805
once,

486
00:03:45,787 --> 00:03:45,986
don't

487
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:46,247
wake

488
00:03:46,306 --> 00:03:46,447
her.

489
00:03:47,649 --> 00:03:47,729
And

490
00:03:47,788 --> 00:03:47,829
I

491
00:03:47,908 --> 00:03:48,409
understood,

492
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,371
I'm

493
00:03:49,411 --> 00:03:49,570
not

494
00:03:49,631 --> 00:03:50,032
dreaming,

495
00:03:50,853 --> 00:03:50,992
I'm

496
00:03:51,032 --> 00:03:51,112
the

497
00:03:51,173 --> 00:03:51,493
dream,

498
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:52,555
she's

499
00:03:52,574 --> 00:03:52,814
still

500
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:53,276
asleep,

501
00:03:54,197 --> 00:03:54,317
I'm

502
00:03:54,356 --> 00:03:54,516
just

503
00:03:54,576 --> 00:03:54,657
the

504
00:03:54,717 --> 00:03:55,018
noise

505
00:03:55,078 --> 00:03:55,177
her

506
00:03:55,258 --> 00:03:55,518
brain

507
00:03:55,578 --> 00:03:55,859
makes

508
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:56,599
when

509
00:03:56,659 --> 00:03:56,780
she

510
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,180
turns

511
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,441
too

512
00:03:57,501 --> 00:03:58,562
deep.

513
00:03:58,542 --> 00:03:58,842
If

514
00:03:58,883 --> 00:03:59,043
you're

515
00:03:59,084 --> 00:03:59,364
fearing

516
00:03:59,405 --> 00:03:59,604
this,

517
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:00,608
then

518
00:04:00,687 --> 00:04:00,908
she's

519
00:04:00,968 --> 00:04:01,289
waking

520
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:01,510
up.

521
00:04:02,312 --> 00:04:02,393
And

522
00:04:02,413 --> 00:04:02,593
you're

523
00:04:02,614 --> 00:04:02,835
part

524
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:02,914
of

525
00:04:02,974 --> 00:04:03,034
it

526
00:04:03,094 --> 00:04:03,256
now.

527
00:04:04,098 --> 00:04:04,278
Look

528
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:04,359
in

529
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:04,459
the

530
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:04,780
mirror.

531
00:04:05,502 --> 00:04:05,663
Tell

532
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:05,782
me

533
00:04:05,842 --> 00:04:06,044
whose

534
00:04:06,123 --> 00:04:06,344
face

535
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:06,545
you

536
00:04:06,605 --> 00:04:07,067
see.
