00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:26,440
I think it was a dream, but it didn't feel like one. The bed wasn't on the floor. It was above water. The ceiling watched me sleep. There was a calendar. Every day was today. The handwriting said it was mine, but I've never written like that. It curled wrong. I tried to leave. There was no door. Just a frame.

2
00:00:26,557 --> 00:00:55,381
When I stepped through, I came back in from above. I was already in the bed, sleeping. The coffee whispered something in a voice I knew from childhood nightmares. The steam spelled words I forgot as soon as I looked away. I opened the closet. The coats were upside down, hanging from sleeves, and they were breathing. I think they knew I was watching.

3
00:00:56,292 --> 00:01:22,954
There was a photo on the wall, a family, my family, I think, but my face was just static. Everyone else was pointing, smiling too wide. I looked outside. The ground was sky. The sky was dirt. Trees grew down from it, like roots. One of them waved at me. The TV was stuck on one image.

4
00:01:23,055 --> 00:01:47,322
Me, screaming, over and over. My mouth moved, but there was no sound. Just the ticking of the house. The mirror didn't show me now. It showed me as a child, crying, mouthing something. I pressed my hand to the glass, and he screamed. I climbed the stairs. They folded up like paper behind me.

5
00:01:47,643 --> 00:02:05,530
There were feet at the top, bare feet, but nobody's just waiting. The fridge was full of clocks. No food, just time, arguing with itself. One ticked backwards. I think it was mine.

6
00:02:06,171 --> 00:02:31,719
There was a book on the table, pages filled with photos, all of me sleeping from angles that don't exist. I ran down the hall, but I had two shadows, one that moved late, one that smiled without a face when I didn't look directly at it. In my room, someone had drawn a door in crayon. It was slightly open, light spilled out.

7
00:02:32,328 --> 00:02:57,082
It hummed like my name, but not how it should sound. There was a cake. My birthday, I think. Too many candles melting backward into tiny wax people. They all looked like me. Someone was under the blanket. I pulled it back. Nothing, but the sheet stayed heavy. It breathed when I touched it.

8
00:02:57,538 --> 00:03:22,835
I found a note, wake up, but the letters were fading every time I blinked until only up was left, and then, not even that. I woke up, I think, but I was still in the bed, on the screen. I watched myself wake up, over and over, each time, more wrong, less human.

9
00:03:23,492 --> 00:03:35,861
I saw myself in a puddle, not here, somewhere else, sleeping, wired up, mouth sown shut, but my eyes, they were wide open.

10
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:58,542
And then I found the room, full of beds, full of me, every bed, another me, all whispering at once, don't wake her. And I understood, I'm not dreaming, I'm the dream, she's still asleep, I'm just the noise her brain makes when she turns too deep.

11
00:03:58,542 --> 00:04:07,046
If you're fearing this, then she's waking up. And you're part of it now. Look in the mirror. Tell me whose face you see.
