00:00:03,076 --> 00:00:03,255

36
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:17,940

37
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:18,800
Not

38
00:00:19,422 --> 00:00:19,582

39
00:00:20,704 --> 00:00:20,963
Cousin

48
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:24,589
But

49
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:24,710
the

50
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,111
birds,

51
00:00:26,353 --> 00:00:26,432
the

52
00:00:26,472 --> 00:00:26,713
birds

53
00:00:26,774 --> 00:00:26,993
looked

54
00:00:27,033 --> 00:00:27,074
at

55
00:00:27,114 --> 00:00:27,675
me.

56
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:28,647
really

57
00:00:28,707 --> 00:00:28,948
looked

58
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:29,109
with

59
00:00:29,149 --> 00:00:29,329
those

60
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:29,870
beady

61
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:30,309
eyes,

62
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:31,192
ancient

63
00:00:31,371 --> 00:00:31,532
eyes.

64
00:00:32,713 --> 00:00:32,853
They

65
00:00:32,893 --> 00:00:33,134
know

66
00:00:33,155 --> 00:00:35,398
everyone

67
00:00:35,438 --> 00:00:35,618
thinks

68
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:35,899
birds

69
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:36,039
are

70
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:36,299
just

71
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,341
birds

72
00:00:38,523 --> 00:00:38,923
wrong.

73
00:00:39,865 --> 00:00:40,085
They're

74
00:00:40,104 --> 00:00:40,185
the

75
00:00:40,225 --> 00:00:40,386
real

76
00:00:40,445 --> 00:00:40,746
people.

77
00:00:41,366 --> 00:00:41,588
They're

78
00:00:41,648 --> 00:00:42,027
hiding

79
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:42,148
in

80
00:00:42,207 --> 00:00:42,509
plain

81
00:00:42,588 --> 00:00:42,950
feathers,

82
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:44,091
plain

83
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:44,371
dumb,

84
00:00:44,392 --> 00:00:44,472
but

85
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:44,692
they're

86
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:45,152
smart.

87
00:00:45,273 --> 00:00:45,372
Oh,

88
00:00:45,393 --> 00:00:45,573
they're

89
00:00:45,654 --> 00:00:45,954
smart.

90
00:00:47,055 --> 00:00:47,136
You

91
00:00:47,176 --> 00:00:47,276
ever

92
00:00:47,316 --> 00:00:47,435
heard

93
00:00:47,475 --> 00:00:47,496
a

94
00:00:47,536 --> 00:00:47,737
crow

95
00:00:47,777 --> 00:00:48,036
laugh?

96
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:48,859
I

97
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:49,079
did

98
00:00:49,098 --> 00:00:49,139
at

99
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:50,079
me

100
00:00:50,902 --> 00:00:51,142
because

101
00:00:51,182 --> 00:00:51,301
he

102
00:00:51,362 --> 00:00:51,503
knew

103
00:00:51,542 --> 00:00:51,563
I

104
00:00:51,762 --> 00:00:52,023
figured

105
00:00:52,063 --> 00:00:52,124
it

106
00:00:52,223 --> 00:00:52,323
out

107
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:53,365
and

108
00:00:53,405 --> 00:00:53,466
he

109
00:00:53,506 --> 00:00:53,606
knew

110
00:00:53,665 --> 00:00:53,725
I

111
00:00:53,765 --> 00:00:53,985
couldn't

112
00:00:54,026 --> 00:00:54,246
prove

113
00:00:54,286 --> 00:00:54,347
it

114
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:55,889
until

115
00:00:55,969 --> 00:00:56,429
now.

116
00:00:57,911 --> 00:00:58,353
every

117
00:00:58,393 --> 00:00:59,554

118
00:00:59,594 --> 00:01:00,494
you've

119
00:01:00,534 --> 00:01:00,735
met,

00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:03,880
simulation,

124
00:01:06,322 --> 00:01:06,403
to

125
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:06,602
keep

126
00:01:06,623 --> 00:01:06,722
you

127
00:01:06,742 --> 00:01:06,864
from

128
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:07,343
asking,

129
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:08,284
why

130
00:01:08,344 --> 00:01:08,465
do

131
00:01:08,566 --> 00:01:08,906
birds

132
00:01:09,025 --> 00:01:09,227

135
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:12,430
I

136
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:12,751
followed

137
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:12,831
an

He

143
00:01:15,054 --> 00:01:15,254
wrote

144
00:01:15,334 --> 00:01:15,614

145
00:01:16,296 --> 00:01:16,415
He

146
00:01:16,516 --> 00:01:16,796
typed

147
00:01:16,855 --> 00:01:16,915

151
00:01:19,058 --> 00:01:19,179
He

152
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:19,680
tweeted,

153
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:20,680
not

154
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:20,882

156
00:01:21,402 --> 00:01:21,662
chirp.

157
00:01:22,242 --> 00:01:22,283
I

158
00:01:22,322 --> 00:01:22,483

185
00:01:37,742 --> 00:01:37,802

man.

192
00:01:42,768 --> 00:01:43,108
Sometimes

193
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,188
I

194
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:43,349

195
00:01:43,368 --> 00:01:43,468

00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:45,311
Wake

201
00:01:46,552 --> 00:01:46,692
They

202
00:01:46,793 --> 00:01:46,992
say,

203
00:01:47,914 --> 00:01:48,114
you're

204
00:01:48,153 --> 00:01:48,254

207
00:01:48,594 --> 00:01:48,795
them.

208
00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:50,456
I

209
00:01:50,516 --> 00:01:50,677
never

210
00:01:50,757 --> 00:01:50,977
was.

211
00:01:51,016 --> 00:01:51,037
I

212
00:01:52,218 --> 00:01:52,358
don't

213
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:52,659
believe.

214
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:53,900
I

215
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,281
molted

216
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:54,561
once.

217
00:01:55,522 --> 00:01:55,561
I

218
00:01:55,602 --> 00:01:55,783
thought

219
00:01:55,822 --> 00:01:55,862
it

220
00:01:55,903 --> 00:01:55,983
was

221
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:56,043
a

222
00:01:56,102 --> 00:01:56,944
rash.

223
00:01:57,581 --> 00:01:57,742
Who

224
00:01:57,781 --> 00:01:57,882
has

225
00:01:57,962 --> 00:01:58,222
wings?

226
00:01:59,084 --> 00:01:59,444
Birds.

227
00:02:00,344 --> 00:02:00,484
Who

228
00:02:00,504 --> 00:02:00,665
sees

229
00:02:00,706 --> 00:02:00,745
an

230
00:02:00,805 --> 00:02:01,346
ultraviolet?

231
00:02:01,947 --> 00:02:02,347
Birds.

232
00:02:03,067 --> 00:02:03,188
Who

233
00:02:03,228 --> 00:02:03,368
built

234
00:02:03,388 --> 00:02:03,468
the

235
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:03,868
pyramids?

236
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:04,971
Birds.

237
00:02:05,811 --> 00:02:05,932
Who

238
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:06,292
invented

239
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:06,632
chess?

240
00:02:07,472 --> 00:02:07,853
Birds.

241
00:02:09,355 --> 00:02:09,515
They're

242
00:02:09,556 --> 00:02:09,955
testing

243
00:02:10,015 --> 00:02:10,137
me.

244
00:02:10,978 --> 00:02:11,117
They

245
00:02:11,237 --> 00:02:11,518
circle

246
00:02:11,557 --> 00:02:11,638
me

247
00:02:11,677 --> 00:02:11,777
when

248
00:02:11,838 --> 00:02:11,899
I

249
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:12,338
sleep.

250
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:13,340
They

251
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:13,681
poop

252
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:13,901
near

253
00:02:13,941 --> 00:02:14,040
me

254
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,161
to

255
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:14,741
communicate.

256
00:02:15,643 --> 00:02:15,742
It's

257
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:15,943
not

258
00:02:15,983 --> 00:02:16,022
an

259
00:02:16,144 --> 00:02:16,503
accident.

260
00:02:17,324 --> 00:02:17,425
It's

261
00:02:17,465 --> 00:02:17,485
a

262
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:18,165
dialect.

263
00:02:19,046 --> 00:02:19,167
I'm

264
00:02:19,247 --> 00:02:19,608
learning.

265
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:21,008
They're

266
00:02:21,028 --> 00:02:21,349
coming.

267
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:22,230
They're

268
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:22,591
taking

269
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:22,871
back

270
00:02:22,911 --> 00:02:23,010
the

271
00:02:23,092 --> 00:02:23,472
earth.

272
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:24,132
And

273
00:02:24,552 --> 00:02:24,652
I,

274
00:02:24,913 --> 00:02:25,033
for

275
00:02:25,253 --> 00:02:25,373
one,

276
00:02:26,134 --> 00:02:26,596
welcome

277
00:02:27,217 --> 00:02:27,396
my

278
00:02:27,677 --> 00:02:28,117
avian

279
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:29,300
overlords.

280
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:31,143
Join

281
00:02:31,182 --> 00:02:31,323
me.

282
00:02:32,144 --> 00:02:32,344
Let's

283
00:02:32,405 --> 00:02:32,724
stop

284
00:02:32,805 --> 00:02:33,406
pretending

285
00:02:33,826 --> 00:02:33,907
to

286
00:02:33,967 --> 00:02:34,086
be

287
00:02:34,247 --> 00:02:34,527
fake

288
00:02:34,627 --> 00:02:35,028
people.

289
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:35,969
Put

290
00:02:36,009 --> 00:02:36,210
down

291
00:02:36,251 --> 00:02:36,371
your

292
00:02:36,411 --> 00:02:36,670
phone.

293
00:02:37,552 --> 00:02:37,733
Pick

294
00:02:37,812 --> 00:02:37,872
up

295
00:02:37,932 --> 00:02:37,953
a

296
00:02:38,013 --> 00:02:38,313
feather.

297
00:02:39,055 --> 00:02:39,414
Become

298
00:02:39,495 --> 00:02:39,596
who

299
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:39,716
you

300
00:02:39,776 --> 00:02:39,855
are

301
00:02:39,955 --> 00:02:40,236
always

302
00:02:40,317 --> 00:02:40,497
meant

303
00:02:40,576 --> 00:02:40,657
to

304
00:02:40,717 --> 00:02:40,937
be.

305
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:42,400
The

306
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:42,980
sky

307
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:43,801
isn't

308
00:02:43,942 --> 00:02:44,042
the

309
00:02:44,102 --> 00:02:44,402
limit.

310
00:02:45,604 --> 00:02:45,724
It's

311
00:02:45,805 --> 00:02:45,905
the

312
00:02:46,246 --> 00:02:46,786
doorway.

313
00:02:47,987 --> 00:02:48,188
Open

314
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:48,348
your

315
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:48,688
wings.

316
00:02:49,591 --> 00:02:49,670
The

317
00:02:49,751 --> 00:02:50,070
nest

318
00:02:50,252 --> 00:02:50,312
is

319
00:02:50,412 --> 00:02:51,112
calling.
