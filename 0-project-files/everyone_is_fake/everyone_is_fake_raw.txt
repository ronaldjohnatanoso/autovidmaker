Read aloud in intense, rambling, nervous and desperate tone.
Speaker 1: LISTEN. I KNOW YOU THINK YOU’RE REAL. BUT YOU’RE NOT. NONE OF YOU ARE. MY BARISTA? CGI. MY MOM? POLYGONAL. MY EX? LOADING ERROR.
I WENT TO A FAMILY REUNION LAST YEAR. NOT ONE PERSON BLINKED. NOT ONE. COUSIN CHAD TURNED INTO A BLUE SCREEN MID-HUG.
BUT THE BIRDS? THE BIRDS LOOKED AT ME. REALLY LOOKED. WITH THOSE BEADY EYES. ANCIENT EYES. THEY KNOW.
EVERYONE THINKS BIRDS ARE JUST… BIRDS. WRONG. THEY’RE THE REAL PEOPLE. THEY’RE HIDING IN PLAIN FEATHERS. PLAYING DUMB. BUT THEY’RE SMART. OH, THEY’RE SMART.
YOU EVER HEARD A CROW LAUGH? I DID. AT ME. BECAUSE HE KNEW I FIGURED IT OUT. AND HE KNEW I COULDN’T PROVE IT. UNTIL NOW.
EVERY 'PERSON' YOU’VE MET? CODE. SIMULATION. HUMANOID PLACEHOLDERS TO KEEP YOU FROM ASKING: WHY DO BIRDS NEVER FILE TAXES?
I FOLLOWED AN OWL FOR FOUR HOURS. HE WROTE NOTES. HE TYPED ON A MINI LAPTOP. HE TWEETED. NOT LIKE 'chirp chirp'—I MEAN ON TWITTER. HE HAS AN ACCOUNT. 48K FOLLOWERS.
I SAW A PIGEON OPEN A DOOR WITH ITS WING. A DOOR. TO A BASEMENT THAT DOESN’T EXIST ON ANY MAP. THEY HAVE HEADQUARTERS, MAN.
SOMETIMES I HEAR THEM IN MY DREAMS. “WAKE UP,” THEY SAY. “YOU’RE NOT ONE OF THEM.” I NEVER WAS. I DON’T BLEED. I MOLTED ONCE. I THOUGHT IT WAS A RASH.
WHO HAS WINGS? BIRDS. WHO SEES IN ULTRAVIOLET? BIRDS. WHO BUILT THE PYRAMIDS? BIRDS. WHO INVENTED CHESS? BIRDS.
THEY’RE TESTING ME. THEY CIRCLE ME WHEN I SLEEP. THEY POOP NEAR ME TO COMMUNICATE. IT’S NOT AN ACCIDENT. IT’S A DIALECT. I’M LEARNING.
THEY’RE COMING. THEY’RE TAKING BACK THE EARTH. AND I, FOR ONE, WELCOME MY AVIAN OVERLORDS.
JOIN ME. LET’S STOP PRETENDING TO BE FAKE PEOPLE. PUT DOWN YOUR PHONE. PICK UP A FEATHER. BECOME WHO YOU WERE ALWAYS MEANT TO BE.
THE SKY ISN’T THE LIMIT. IT’S THE DOORWAY. OPEN YOUR WINGS. THE NEST IS CALLING.
