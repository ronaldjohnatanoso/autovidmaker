00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:50,908
Funny

00:00:58,219 --> 00:00:58,680
That's

117
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,381

00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:05,510

135
00:01:08,674 --> 00:01:08,956
That's

136
00:01:08,956 --> 00:01:09,156

140
00:01:10,117 --> 00:01:10,397
"My

147
00:01:13,361 --> 00:01:13,561
So

148
00:01:13,561 --> 00:01:13,742
he

149
00:01:13,742 --> 00:01:14,183

159
00:01:20,153 --> 00:01:20,352
But

00:01:20,352 --> 00:01:20,733
daddy

161
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:20,974

Threw

248
00:01:59,772 --> 00:02:00,052
You

249
00:02:00,052 --> 00:02:00,373

Daddy

255
00:02:02,597 --> 00:02:02,959
said,

256
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:03,280
"Son,

yours.

262
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:07,007
But

263
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:07,248
your

267
00:02:08,349 --> 00:02:09,132
and

268
00:02:09,132 --> 00:02:09,451
