Funny

That's

117

135
00:01:02,316 --> 00:01:02,637
That's

136
00:01:02,637 --> 00:01:02,837

140
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:04,180
"My

147
00:01:07,128 --> 00:01:07,328
So

148
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:07,489
he

149
00:01:07,489 --> 00:01:07,930

248
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:50,578
You

Daddy

255
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:53,164
said,

256
00:01:53,164 --> 00:01:53,483
"Son,

yours.

262
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:56,209
But

263
00:01:56,209 --> 00:01:56,471
