Settle in, friend. Got a story from Luke 15, the prodigal son. Been chewing on this one for decades. Jesus told it to folks who thought they had God figured out. Still speaks today. Boy wanted his inheritance early. Basically told his daddy, I wish you were dead.

00:00:24,297 --> 00:00:52,090
But that father, he gave it anyway. Love don't hold tight when it needs to let go. Boy took everything and ran, thought freedom meant distance from home. He lived it up, wine, women, whatever his heart desired. Money flows like water when you ain't earned it. But pockets got empty, friends disappeared. Funny how that works.

00:00:52,731 --> 00:01:20,052
Ended up sloppin' pigs, Jewish boy, unclean animals. That shame piled on shame. Got so hungry, pig food looked good. Pride tastes bitter when your belly's empty. That's when it hit him. My father's serfants eat bitter than this. So he started home, practiced his speech every step. Father, I've sinned.

00:01:20,153 --> 00:01:40,572
But Daddy was watching, every day, waiting. Soon as he saw that boy, oh the joy, ran like a young man, didn't walk with dignity, ran through his arms around that dirty, smelly boy. Boy started his speech, Daddy cut him off with kisses.

00:01:40,656 --> 00:01:51,439
Called for the best robe, ringed for his finger. This is my son. Killed the fattened calf, threw a party that shook the rafters.

6
00:01:51,676 --> 00:02:10,794
But the older brother, he heard the music from the field, got mad, said, I've been faithful all these years. You never threw me a party. Daddy said, son, everything I have is yours, but your brother was dead and now he's alive.

7
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:38,992
See, there's two sons in all of us. One runs wild, one stays bitter. But the father, he loves them both. Runs to the rebel, reaches for the righteous. Maybe you're the prodigal, far from home, eating with pigs. He's watching the road, waiting to run. Or maybe you're the older brother, keeping score, missing the joy.

8
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:52,324
Either way, Dad is calling you home. The party's already started. There's a place at the table. Robe with your name on it. Come on home, child. Your father's been waiting.
