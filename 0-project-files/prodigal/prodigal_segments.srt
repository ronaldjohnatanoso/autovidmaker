Settle in, friend. Got a story from Luke 15, the prodigal son. Been chewing on this one for decades. Jesus told it to folks who thought they had God figured out. Still speaks today. Boy wanted his inheritance early. Basically told his daddy, I wish you were dead. But that father, he gave it anyway. Love don't hold tight when it needs to let go.

00:00:29,207 --> 00:00:55,363
Boy took everything and ran. Thought freedom meant distance from home. He lived it up. Wine, women, whatever his heart desired. Money flows like water when you ain't earned it. But pockets got empty. Friends disappeared. Funny how that works. Ended up sloppin' pigs. Jewish boy, unclean animals. That shame piled on shame.

Got so hungry, pig food looked good. Pride tastes bitter when your belly's empty. That's when it hit him. My father's servants eat better than this. So he started home. Practiced his speech every step. Father, I've sinned.

00:01:13,234 --> 00:01:28,810
but daddy was watching every day, waiting. Soon as he saw that boy, oh the joy, ran like a young man, didn't walk with dignity, ran, threw his arms around that dirty smelly boy.

00:01:29,046 --> 00:01:52,402
Boys started his speech. Daddy cut him off with kisses. Called for the best robe. Ring for his finger. This is my son. Killed the fattened calf. Threw a party that shook the rafters. But the older brother, he heard the music from the field. Got mad. Said, I've been faithful all these years. You never threw me a party.

00:01:52,402 --> 00:02:12,044
Daddy said, son, everything I have is yours, but your brother was dead, and now he's alive. See, there's two sons in all of us. One runs wild, one stays bitter. But the father, he loves them both. Runs to the rebel, reaches for the righteous.

00:02:12,044 --> 00:02:36,580
Maybe you're the prodigal, far from home, eating with pigs. He's watching the road, waiting to run. Or maybe you're the older brother, keeping score, missing the joy. Either way, daddy's calling you home. The party's already started. There's a place at the table. Road with your name on it. Come on home, child. Your father's been waiting.
