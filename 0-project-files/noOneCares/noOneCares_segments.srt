Why would anyone care about you? I mean, really? Who the hell are you? You're another name in a sea of names. Background noise. Replaceable. Forgettable. And you know what? That's fine. That's freedom. If nobody's watching, there's no act to perform. No weight to carry but your own. You get to define what matters. Not them. Not the world. You.

So build what you want. Even if no one sees it. Especially then. It's yours. Don't wait to be important. Don't wait to be seen. You're already happening. You're not here to be remembered. You're here to live. Even if it's pointless. Especially if it's pointless. Let insignificance be a relief. No pressure. No stage. Just motion. Just breath. Just defiance in the face of nothing.

You don't need to matter to anyone. You just need to keep going. And that might be the most powerful thing left.
