1
00:00:00,233 --> 00:00:00,493
Why

2
00:00:00,533 --> 00:00:00,693
would

3
00:00:00,754 --> 00:00:01,094
anyone

4
00:00:01,234 --> 00:00:01,494
care

5
00:00:01,554 --> 00:00:01,794
about

6
00:00:01,895 --> 00:00:02,115
you?

7
00:00:02,875 --> 00:00:02,915
I

8
00:00:02,976 --> 00:00:03,156
mean,

9
00:00:03,196 --> 00:00:04,136
really?

10
00:00:04,758 --> 00:00:04,918
Who

11
00:00:04,937 --> 00:00:05,038
the

12
00:00:05,078 --> 00:00:05,258
hell

13
00:00:05,378 --> 00:00:05,477
are

14
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:05,698
you?

15
00:00:06,578 --> 00:00:06,799
You're

16
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:07,139
another

17
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:07,580
name

18
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:07,719
in

19
00:00:07,761 --> 00:00:07,801
a

20
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:08,240
sea

21
00:00:08,301 --> 00:00:08,340
of

22
00:00:08,381 --> 00:00:08,961
names.

23
00:00:09,762 --> 00:00:10,362
Background

24
00:00:10,462 --> 00:00:10,843
noise.

25
00:00:11,603 --> 00:00:12,345
Replaceable.

26
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:13,787
Forgettable.

27
00:00:15,028 --> 00:00:15,108
And

28
00:00:15,128 --> 00:00:15,208
you

29
00:00:15,247 --> 00:00:15,387
know

30
00:00:15,428 --> 00:00:15,628
what?

31
00:00:16,268 --> 00:00:16,509
That's

32
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:16,949
fine.

33
00:00:17,771 --> 00:00:17,971
That's

34
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:18,411
freedom.

35
00:00:19,551 --> 00:00:19,611
If

36
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:20,172
nobody's

37
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:20,734
watching,

38
00:00:21,634 --> 00:00:21,875
there's

39
00:00:21,934 --> 00:00:22,074
no

40
00:00:22,274 --> 00:00:22,454
act

41
00:00:22,574 --> 00:00:22,675
to

42
00:00:22,736 --> 00:00:23,196
perform.

43
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:24,137
No

44
00:00:24,216 --> 00:00:24,477
weight

45
00:00:24,516 --> 00:00:24,617
to

46
00:00:24,696 --> 00:00:25,077
carry,

47
00:00:25,678 --> 00:00:25,798
but

48
00:00:25,838 --> 00:00:26,018
your

49
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:26,239
own.

50
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:27,620
You

51
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:27,800
get

52
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:27,920
to

53
00:00:27,981 --> 00:00:28,341
define

54
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:28,541
what

55
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:28,981
matters.

56
00:00:29,621 --> 00:00:29,803
Not

57
00:00:29,862 --> 00:00:30,222
them.

58
00:00:30,963 --> 00:00:31,182
Not

59
00:00:31,202 --> 00:00:31,324
the

60
00:00:31,384 --> 00:00:31,743
world.

61
00:00:32,725 --> 00:00:32,985
You.

62
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:34,328
So

63
00:00:34,408 --> 00:00:34,709
build

64
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:34,908
what

65
00:00:34,948 --> 00:00:35,109
you

66
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:35,490
want.

67
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:36,570
Even

68
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:36,692
if

69
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:37,031
no

70
00:00:37,112 --> 00:00:37,231
one

71
00:00:37,332 --> 00:00:37,633
sees

72
00:00:37,732 --> 00:00:37,792
it.

73
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:39,375
Especially

74
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:39,636
then.

75
00:00:39,676 --> 00:00:40,978
It's

76
00:00:41,018 --> 00:00:41,399
yours.

77
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:42,720
Don't

78
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:42,981
wait

79
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:43,081
to

80
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:43,240
be

81
00:00:43,301 --> 00:00:43,841
important.

82
00:00:44,542 --> 00:00:44,704
Don't

83
00:00:44,723 --> 00:00:44,884
wait

84
00:00:44,923 --> 00:00:45,003
to

85
00:00:45,064 --> 00:00:45,164
be

86
00:00:45,265 --> 00:00:45,604
seen.

87
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:46,707
You're

88
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:47,387
already

89
00:00:47,487 --> 00:00:48,009
happening.

90
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:49,170
You're

91
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:49,310
not

92
00:00:49,451 --> 00:00:49,691
here

93
00:00:49,731 --> 00:00:49,790
to

94
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:49,932
be

95
00:00:49,972 --> 00:00:50,593
remembered.

96
00:00:51,192 --> 00:00:51,393
You're

97
00:00:51,454 --> 00:00:51,594
here

98
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:51,713
to

99
00:00:51,814 --> 00:00:52,115
live.

100
00:00:53,237 --> 00:00:53,396
Even

101
00:00:53,457 --> 00:00:53,496
if

102
00:00:53,576 --> 00:00:53,697
it's

103
00:00:53,777 --> 00:00:54,237
pointless.

104
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:55,799
Especially

105
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,220
if

106
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:56,401
it's

107
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:56,881
pointless.

108
00:00:58,084 --> 00:00:58,264
Let

109
00:00:58,283 --> 00:00:59,265
insignificance

110
00:00:59,345 --> 00:00:59,485
be

111
00:00:59,526 --> 00:00:59,545
a

112
00:00:59,566 --> 00:01:00,226
relief.

113
00:01:00,814 --> 00:01:01,034
No

114
00:01:01,155 --> 00:01:01,576
pressure,

115
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:02,478
no

116
00:01:02,578 --> 00:01:03,058
stage,

117
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:04,301
just

118
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:04,923
motion,

119
00:01:05,724 --> 00:01:05,884
just

120
00:01:06,045 --> 00:01:06,405
breath,

121
00:01:07,466 --> 00:01:07,647
just

122
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:08,528
defiance

123
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:08,890
in

124
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:09,010
the

125
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:09,370
face

126
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:09,471
of

127
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:09,992
nothing.

128
00:01:11,495 --> 00:01:11,614
You

129
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:11,795
don't

130
00:01:11,834 --> 00:01:12,016
need

131
00:01:12,055 --> 00:01:12,135
to

132
00:01:12,236 --> 00:01:12,557
matter

133
00:01:12,617 --> 00:01:12,697
to

134
00:01:12,876 --> 00:01:13,278
anyone.

135
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:14,519
You

136
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:14,760
just

137
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:14,980
need

138
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:15,061
to

139
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:15,361
keep

140
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:15,783
going.

141
00:01:17,165 --> 00:01:17,265
And

142
00:01:17,365 --> 00:01:17,706
that

143
00:01:18,808 --> 00:01:19,028
might

144
00:01:19,108 --> 00:01:19,228
be

145
00:01:19,248 --> 00:01:19,368
the

146
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:19,609
most

147
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:20,131
powerful

148
00:01:20,191 --> 00:01:20,370
thing

149
00:01:20,411 --> 00:01:20,831
left.
