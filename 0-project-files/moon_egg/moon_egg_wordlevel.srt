00:00:01,231 --> 00:00:01,413
eyes.

4
00:00:02,032 --> 00:00:02,153
The

5
00:00:02,193 --> 00:00:02,533
moon

6
00:00:02,714 --> 00:00:02,975
isn't

7
00:00:02,995 --> 00:00:03,015
a

8
00:00:03,174 --> 00:00:03,515
rock.

9
00:00:03,654 --> 00:00:03,795
It's

10
00:00:03,835 --> 00:00:03,875
a

11
00:00:03,976 --> 00:00:04,435
giant

12
00:00:04,737 --> 00:00:05,017
egg!

13
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:05,578
A

14
00:00:05,658 --> 00:00:06,399
celestial

15
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:07,080
omelet.

16
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:07,740
Our

17
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:08,502
ancestors

18
00:00:08,582 --> 00:00:08,862
knew.

19
00:00:08,901 --> 00:00:09,423
The

20
00:00:09,503 --> 00:00:09,782
truth

21
00:00:09,903 --> 00:00:10,022
was

22
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:10,144
in

23
00:00:10,183 --> 00:00:10,263
the

24
00:00:10,323 --> 00:00:10,823
caves.

25
00:00:11,224 --> 00:00:11,384
They

26
00:00:11,425 --> 00:00:11,625
drew

27
00:00:11,664 --> 00:00:11,746
the

28
00:00:11,826 --> 00:00:12,205
moon

29
00:00:12,266 --> 00:00:12,707
with

30
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:13,368
feathers.

31
00:00:14,148 --> 00:00:14,329
It's

32
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:14,628
made

33
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:14,728
of

34
00:00:14,788 --> 00:00:15,050
rock.

35
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:15,689
The

36
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:16,071
salt.

37
00:00:16,652 --> 00:00:17,152
Regolith.

38
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:17,832
You

39
00:00:17,873 --> 00:00:17,972
can

40
00:00:18,013 --> 00:00:18,152
look

41
00:00:18,193 --> 00:00:18,314
this

42
00:00:18,434 --> 00:00:18,513
up.

43
00:00:19,195 --> 00:00:19,335
It's

44
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:19,594
not

45
00:00:19,695 --> 00:00:20,356
soft-boiled

46
00:00:20,455 --> 00:00:20,797
space

47
00:00:20,836 --> 00:00:21,196
poultry.

48
00:00:21,838 --> 00:00:22,038
There's

49
00:00:22,077 --> 00:00:22,198
no

50
00:00:22,278 --> 00:00:22,618
evidence

51
00:00:22,678 --> 00:00:22,719

52
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:23,120

53
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:23,539
no

54
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,060
shell,

55
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:24,501
no

56
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:24,942

57
00:00:25,062 --> 00:00:25,222
no

58
00:00:25,402 --> 00:00:25,742
clucking

59
00:00:25,803 --> 00:00:26,163
sounds.

60
00:00:26,202 --> 00:00:26,324
It's

61
00:00:26,403 --> 00:00:27,445
just...

62
00:00:27,464 --> 00:00:27,565
the

63
00:00:27,605 --> 00:00:28,265
moon.

64
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:28,507
And

65
00:00:28,567 --> 00:00:28,746
yet,

66
00:00:29,108 --> 00:00:29,187
the

67
00:00:29,288 --> 00:00:29,669
moon

68
00:00:29,768 --> 00:00:30,370
controls

69
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,530
the

70
00:00:30,611 --> 00:00:31,112
tides,

71
00:00:31,594 --> 00:00:31,713
like

72
00:00:31,774 --> 00:00:31,794
a

73
00:00:31,873 --> 00:00:32,255
womb,

74
00:00:32,274 --> 00:00:32,295
a

75
00:00:33,036 --> 00:00:33,537
motherly

76
00:00:33,578 --> 00:00:34,039
egg,

77
00:00:34,098 --> 00:00:35,142
cradling

78
00:00:35,182 --> 00:00:35,281
the

79
00:00:35,362 --> 00:00:35,703
sea.

80
00:00:35,762 --> 00:00:36,704
Ever

81
00:00:36,765 --> 00:00:37,026
wonder

82
00:00:37,085 --> 00:00:37,246
why

83
00:00:37,286 --> 00:00:37,787
eggs

84
00:00:37,868 --> 00:00:38,048
look

85
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:38,590
exactly

86
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:38,770
like

87
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:38,909
the

88
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:39,231
moon

89
00:00:39,271 --> 00:00:39,331
if

90
00:00:39,371 --> 00:00:39,512
you

91
00:00:39,591 --> 00:00:39,953
squint

92
00:00:39,993 --> 00:00:40,232
hard

93
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:40,533
enough?

94
00:00:41,134 --> 00:00:41,796
Coincidence

95
00:00:42,457 --> 00:00:42,539
or

96
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:43,280
cosmic

97
00:00:43,401 --> 00:00:44,482
symbolism?

98
00:00:44,767 --> 00:00:45,287
Okay,

99
00:00:45,307 --> 00:00:45,468
but

100
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:46,951
symbolism

101
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:47,271
isn't

102
00:00:47,472 --> 00:00:47,872
physics.

103
00:00:48,573 --> 00:00:48,695
You

104
00:00:48,734 --> 00:00:48,935
can't

105
00:00:48,975 --> 00:00:49,134
just

106
00:00:49,195 --> 00:00:49,496
scream

107
00:00:49,536 --> 00:00:49,996

111
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:50,978

112
00:00:51,158 --> 00:00:51,359

113
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:51,460
it

114
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:51,941
science.

115
00:00:52,781 --> 00:00:53,082
Also,

116
00:00:53,122 --> 00:00:53,624
your

117
00:00:53,704 --> 00:00:54,104

119
00:00:54,284 --> 00:00:54,606

named

129
00:00:58,232 --> 00:00:59,856
EggLord420.

130
00:01:00,088 --> 00:01:00,630
NASA

131
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:00,850

132
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:01,310

133
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:01,469
the

134
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:01,930
truth.

135
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:02,572
They

136
00:01:02,631 --> 00:01:03,012
landed

137
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:03,192

patch

139
00:01:03,673 --> 00:01:03,753
the

141
00:01:04,474 --> 00:01:04,573
to

142
00:01:04,653 --> 00:01:04,974

143
00:01:05,054 --> 00:01:05,153
the

00:01:05,213 --> 00:01:05,534

145
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:06,355
One

146
00:01:06,396 --> 00:01:06,615

147
00:01:06,656 --> 00:01:06,915
it

148
00:01:06,995 --> 00:01:07,256

149
00:01:07,337 --> 00:01:07,716
hatch.

150
00:01:08,216 --> 00:01:08,298
And

151
00:01:08,358 --> 00:01:08,498
when

152
00:01:08,558 --> 00:01:08,617
it

153
00:01:08,658 --> 00:01:08,957
does,

154
00:01:08,998 --> 00:01:09,539
the

00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:10,078

156
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:10,340

00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:11,060
full

159
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:11,641

161
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:13,123

164
00:01:14,984 --> 00:01:15,305
No,

165
00:01:15,364 --> 00:01:16,245
stop.

166
00:01:16,686 --> 00:01:17,227
Please.

167
00:01:17,266 --> 00:01:18,128
Moons

168
00:01:18,188 --> 00:01:18,408
don't

169
00:01:18,528 --> 00:01:18,929
hatch.

170
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:19,790
That's

171
00:01:19,849 --> 00:01:19,989
not

172
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:20,069
a

173
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:20,670
sentence

174
00:01:20,751 --> 00:01:20,771
I

175
00:01:20,811 --> 00:01:20,990
should

176
00:01:21,051 --> 00:01:21,251
have

177
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:21,370

178
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:21,570
say

179
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:21,751
out

180
00:01:21,811 --> 00:01:22,171
loud.

181
00:01:22,212 --> 00:01:23,093
This

182
00:01:23,192 --> 00:01:23,253
is

183
00:01:23,293 --> 00:01:23,492
just

184
00:01:23,653 --> 00:01:24,334
spirals

185
00:01:24,414 --> 00:01:24,513
and

186
00:01:24,534 --> 00:01:25,114
arrows.

187
00:01:25,775 --> 00:01:25,975
You've

188
00:01:26,036 --> 00:01:26,355
drawn

189
00:01:26,396 --> 00:01:26,436
an

190
00:01:26,637 --> 00:01:26,796
egg

191
00:01:26,956 --> 00:01:27,117
over

192
00:01:27,236 --> 00:01:27,417
every

193
00:01:27,477 --> 00:01:27,817
planet,

194
00:01:27,957 --> 00:01:28,117
even

195
00:01:28,177 --> 00:01:28,578
Jupiter.

196
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:29,859
Why?

197
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,340
Because

198
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:30,521
the

199
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:30,980
whole

200
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:31,462
solar

201
00:01:31,522 --> 00:01:31,902
system

202
00:01:32,043 --> 00:01:32,123
is

203
00:01:32,203 --> 00:01:32,222
a

204
00:01:32,302 --> 00:01:32,884
breakfast.

205
00:01:33,463 --> 00:01:33,685
Earth

206
00:01:33,784 --> 00:01:33,864
is

207
00:01:33,944 --> 00:01:34,045
the

208
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:34,525
toast.

209
00:01:35,025 --> 00:01:35,406
Saturn

210
00:01:35,466 --> 00:01:35,546
is

211
00:01:35,606 --> 00:01:35,626
a

212
00:01:35,727 --> 00:01:36,126
donut.

213
00:01:36,628 --> 00:01:37,149
Uranus?

214
00:01:37,748 --> 00:01:38,230
Obviously

215
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:38,370
the

216
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:38,790
deuce.

217
00:01:39,311 --> 00:01:39,430
It's

218
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:39,772
called

219
00:01:39,831 --> 00:01:39,932
the

220
00:01:40,052 --> 00:01:40,432
brunch

221
00:01:40,492 --> 00:01:40,873
theory.

222
00:01:40,912 --> 00:01:41,414
They

223
00:01:41,453 --> 00:01:41,614
don't

224
00:01:41,674 --> 00:01:41,894
teach

225
00:01:41,953 --> 00:01:42,114
this

226
00:01:42,194 --> 00:01:42,254
in

227
00:01:42,355 --> 00:01:42,694
school

228
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:43,335
because

229
00:01:43,355 --> 00:01:43,475
the

230
00:01:43,615 --> 00:01:43,936
chicken

231
00:01:44,156 --> 00:01:44,718
overlords

232
00:01:44,837 --> 00:01:45,097
run

233
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:45,237
the

234
00:01:45,317 --> 00:01:45,838
textbook

235
00:01:45,918 --> 00:01:46,579
industry.

236
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:46,620
I

237
00:01:47,561 --> 00:01:47,680
have

238
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:48,322
three

239
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:49,403
PhDs.

240
00:01:50,203 --> 00:01:50,243
I

241
00:01:50,284 --> 00:01:50,384
was

242
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:50,745
published

243
00:01:50,805 --> 00:01:50,844
in

244
00:01:50,924 --> 00:01:51,325
Nature.

245
00:01:51,364 --> 00:01:52,606
Now

246
00:01:52,647 --> 00:01:52,766
I'm

247
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:53,188
arguing

248
00:01:53,227 --> 00:01:53,328
with

249
00:01:53,388 --> 00:01:53,628
someone

250
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:53,748
who

251
00:01:53,787 --> 00:01:53,968
thinks

252
00:01:54,228 --> 00:01:54,748
Mercury

253
00:01:54,769 --> 00:01:54,989
is

254
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:55,090
an

255
00:01:55,129 --> 00:01:55,549
egg

256
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:56,150
timer.

257
00:01:57,632 --> 00:01:57,953
Maybe

258
00:01:57,993 --> 00:01:58,114
we

259
00:01:58,155 --> 00:01:58,576
deserve

260
00:01:58,617 --> 00:01:58,697
the

261
00:01:58,736 --> 00:01:59,039
giant

262
00:01:59,078 --> 00:01:59,319
space

263
00:01:59,359 --> 00:01:59,641
chicken.

264
00:02:00,545 --> 00:02:00,745
Maybe

265
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:00,945
that's

266
00:02:00,986 --> 00:02:01,388
justice.

267
00:02:02,031 --> 00:02:02,111
The

268
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:02,492
truth

269
00:02:02,793 --> 00:02:02,853
is

270
00:02:03,034 --> 00:02:03,174
out

271
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:03,496
there

272
00:02:03,537 --> 00:02:04,219
and

273
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:04,420
it's

274
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:04,941
peeping.

275
00:02:05,003 --> 00:02:05,865
Wake

276
00:02:05,986 --> 00:02:06,167
up,

277
00:02:06,186 --> 00:02:06,489
shell

278
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:06,870
heads.

279
00:02:07,272 --> 00:02:07,391
The

280
00:02:07,453 --> 00:02:07,754
yolk

281
00:02:08,034 --> 00:02:08,134
is

282
00:02:08,155 --> 00:02:08,497
on

283
00:02:08,637 --> 00:02:08,998
you.

284
00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:09,079
The

285
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,664
age

286
00:02:10,825 --> 00:02:10,885
of

287
00:02:10,926 --> 00:02:11,026
the

288
00:02:11,086 --> 00:02:11,367
moon

289
00:02:11,429 --> 00:02:11,770
chicken

290
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,312
is

291
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:13,295
nigh.
