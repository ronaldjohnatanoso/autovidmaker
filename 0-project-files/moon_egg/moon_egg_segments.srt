Open your eyes. The moon isn't a rock. It's a giant egg! A celestial omelet. Our ancestors knew. The truth was in the caves. They drew the moon with feathers. It's made of rock. The salt. Regolith. You can look this up. It's not soft-boiled space poultry. There's no evidence of yolk, no shell, no beak, no clucking sounds. It's just... the moon.

And yet, the moon controls the tides, like a womb, a motherly egg, cradling the sea. Ever wonder why eggs look exactly like the moon if you squint hard enough? Coincidence or cosmic symbolism?

Okay, but symbolism isn't physics. You can't just scream egg at the sky and call it science. Also, your sources are mostly Facebook memes and one forum post by someone named EggLord420.

NASA is hiding the truth. They landed to patch the shell, to stop the birth. One day it will hatch. And when it does, the sky will be full of beak, full of beak. No, stop. Please. Moons don't hatch. That's not a sentence I should have to say out loud. This is just spirals and arrows. You've drawn an egg over every planet, even Jupiter. Why?

Because the whole solar system is a breakfast. Earth is the toast. Saturn is a donut. Uranus? Obviously the deuce. It's called the brunch theory. They don't teach this in school because the chicken overlords run the textbook industry. I have three PhDs. I was published in Nature. Now I'm arguing with someone who thinks Mercury is an egg timer.

Maybe we deserve the giant space chicken. Maybe that's justice. The truth is out there and it's peeping. Wake up, shell heads. The yolk is on you. The age of the moon chicken is nigh.
