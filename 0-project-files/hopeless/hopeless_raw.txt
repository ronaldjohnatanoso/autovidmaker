Monotone. Tired. As if you’ve already said this a hundred times. Speak like the world ended years ago and nobody noticed.
Speaker 1: 
There’s no grand lesson here. No moment of clarity. Just another night that bleeds into another morning that doesn’t matter.
Everyone’s moving. Talking. Smiling. But it’s all noise. No one’s really here. They never were.
Time used to mean something. Now it just loops. Eats itself. Days recycle. Nothing sticks.
I keep trying to remember faces. But even the memories rot. Everyone I ever loved feels like a dream I lied about having.
They say, 'You’ll be okay.' But they’re just trying to calm themselves. Nobody really knows what they're doing. They're just scared you'll say what they’re thinking.
Hope feels fake now. Like a commercial. Bright colors over a dead signal. I can’t even pretend to believe in it anymore. And honestly, I don’t miss it.
Some nights I wonder what it would feel like to disappear, not in some dramatic way—just quietly. Like smoke. Like static fading out.
And if someone found this, this voice, this thought… I don’t think it would matter. They’d just scroll past. Skip. Forget. We all do.
We keep looking forward like there’s something coming. Like there's a break in the sky. But there’s not. There never was.
Sometimes the exit is just another room. Same shape. Same silence. New wallpaper. Nothing changes.
You won’t be remembered. Neither will I. We were here, and then we weren’t. And the world won’t even flinch.
If you're listening... don’t look for hope here. There’s none. Just the truth. Just the quiet. Just the end.
