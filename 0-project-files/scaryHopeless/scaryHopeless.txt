voice_instruction: Monotone. Fading. Speak like the words are old and used up. Towards the end, let some dread creep in — not panic, but recognition. Like remembering something you were never meant to remember.

Speaker 1:

<p1 image_prompt="bedroom with curtains drawn, dim light leaking in, everything slightly tilted like the room is off-balance">I wake up every morning and forget why. I just move through the hours like I owe someone time. But I don’t know who.</p1>

<p2 image_prompt="cup of coffee sitting untouched for days, mold growing on the surface, but still steaming">Nothing changes. I try to care. About the news. About people. About myself. But it’s like chewing air. I don’t feel full. I don’t feel anything.</p2>

<p3 image_prompt="family photo where everyone has their back turned, except one face staring directly into the lens, eyes pitch black">I went through old photos last night. Some of them… I don’t remember being in. Some of those people—I don’t think they ever existed. But they know me. I can feel it. I can feel them watching through the paper.</p3>

<p4 image_prompt="peeling wallpaper revealing eyes underneath, staring from the wall like it’s alive">There are eyes in the walls. I used to think it was the depression. That I was unraveling. But they blink. In sync. They’re not mine.</p4>

<p5 image_prompt="mirror with no reflection, just a copy of the room behind, but subtly wrong — furniture misplaced, bloodstain where there is none in real room">The mirror lied today. It showed me standing still. But I was moving. Only slightly. Just enough to see it. Like he didn’t know I was watching.</p5>

<p6 image_prompt="TV playing static, but faintly visible in the fuzz is a person screaming with no sound, mouthing 'let me out' over and over">The static on the TV started whispering. Not words—locations. Coordinates. I looked one up. It’s just an empty field now. But someone built a door there. No handle. No hinges. Just… a door. Waiting.</p6>

<p7 image_prompt="clock face showing 13 o’clock, seconds hand ticking backwards, reflected in a pool of blood">Time’s been breaking lately. I’ll lose hours. Then suddenly it’s the same hour again. But I’m not where I was. My hands are dirty. Sometimes wet. I stopped asking why.</p7>

<p8 image_prompt="open notebook filled with someone else's handwriting, every page ends with 'she remembers you'">There’s a journal I never wrote in. But it has my name on the cover. Inside, it talks about a woman. Faceless. Endless. It says she’s underneath everything. And she wants me to remember her.</p8>

<p9 image_prompt="bed with imprint of a body, but no one’s in it, and the sheets are rising and falling like someone’s breathing">Last night, the bed sank. Like someone lay down beside me. I didn’t turn to look. I just… listened. It hummed. Familiar. Like a lullaby I never learned but already feared.</p9>

<p10 image_prompt="blank Polaroid photo slowly developing the speaker’s face, but with no mouth and open eyes crying blood">I think I’ve died before. Not metaphorically. I mean I’ve died. Over and over. And something keeps bringing me back. Resetting the same misery. Like it’s feeding off it. Off me.</p10>

<p11 image_prompt="dark hallway that seems to stretch forever, at the end is a version of the speaker standing still, smiling too wide, holding something behind their back">I walked down the hall today and saw myself waiting at the end. Same clothes. Same skin. But he smiled. And I never smile. I asked what he wanted. He said, “To finish what you started.”</p11>

<p12 image_prompt="mouth on wall whispering, ear just above it listening, face unseen, but tears running down from where it should be">I think I’m not supposed to be awake. Not like this. I’m not supposed to know. Every time I get close, the world twists. Distracts me. Sends someone to knock. Turn on a light. Make me forget again.</p12>

<p13 image_prompt="recording device playing voice of speaker but distorted, overlapping, repeating the phrase 'She’s almost through.'">But I’m remembering faster now. And she’s getting closer. She doesn’t knock. She bleeds into the air. And when she finally steps through, there won’t be a reset. No loop. Just... her.</p13>

<p14 image_prompt="distant forest burning, and in the flames a silhouette dancing, limbs too long, smile glowing">This isn’t depression. This isn’t grief. This is infection. I saw her in the flames. She doesn’t bring death. She erases the idea of life itself.</p14>

<p15 image_prompt="blank screen, text appears slowly: 'you were warned.'">So if you're hearing this, it means I failed again. It means I left the door open.</p15>
