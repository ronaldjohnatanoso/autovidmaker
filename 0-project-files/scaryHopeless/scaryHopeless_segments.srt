00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:27,824
I wake up every morning and forget why. I just move through the hours like I owe someone time. But I don't know who. Nothing changes. I try to care. About the news. About people. About myself. But it's like chewing air. I don't feel full. I don't feel anything.

00:00:28,718 --> 00:00:57,203
I went through old photos last night. Some of them I don't remember being in. Some of those people, I don't think they ever existed, but they know me. I can feel it. I can feel them watching through the paper. There are eyes in the walls. I used to think it was the depression that I was unraveling, but they blink in sync.

3
00:00:58,012 --> 00:01:25,840
They're not mine. The mirror lied today. It showed me standing still. But I was moving. Only slightly. Just enough to see it. Like he didn't know I was watching. The static on the TV started whispering. Not words. Locations. I looked one up. It's just an empty field now.

4
00:01:26,313 --> 00:01:55,557
But someone built a door there. No handle. No hinges. Just... a door. Waiting. Time's been breaking lately. I lose hours. Then suddenly it's the same hour again. But I'm not where I was. My hands are dirty. Sometimes wet. I stopped asking why. There's a journal I never wrote in.

5
00:01:56,063 --> 00:02:24,294
But it has my name on the cover. Inside it talks about a woman. Faceless. Endless. It says she's underneath everything. And she wants me to remember her. Last night the bed sank. Like someone lay down beside me. I didn't turn to look. I just... listened. It hummed. Familiar.

6
00:02:24,616 --> 00:02:54,163
Like a lullaby I never learned but already feared. I think I've died before. Not metaphorically. I mean I've died. Over and over. And something keeps bringing me back. Resetting the same misery. Like it's feeding off it. Off me. I walked down the hall today. And saw myself waiting at the end.

7
00:02:54,956 --> 00:03:24,151
Same clothes. Same skin. But he smiled. And I never smile. I asked what he wanted. He said, to finish what you started. I think I'm not supposed to be awake. Not like this. I'm not supposed to know. Every time I get close, the world twists. Distracts me. Send someone to knock.

8
00:03:24,758 --> 00:03:52,788
turn on a light make me forget again but I'm remembering faster now and she's getting closer she doesn't knock she bleeds into the air and when she finally steps through there won't be a reset no loop just her this isn't depression this isn't grief

9
00:03:53,580 --> 00:04:13,240
This is infection. I saw her in the flames. She doesn't bring death. She erases the idea of life itself. So if you're hearing this, it means I failed again. It means I left the door open.
