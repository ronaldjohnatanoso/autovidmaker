Monotone. Fading. Speak like the words are old and used up. Towards the end, let some dread creep in — not panic, but recognition. Like remembering something you were never meant to remember.
Speaker 1: 
I wake up every morning and forget why. I just move through the hours like I owe someone time. But I don’t know who.
Nothing changes. I try to care. About the news. About people. About myself. But it’s like chewing air. I don’t feel full. I don’t feel anything.
I went through old photos last night. Some of them… I don’t remember being in. Some of those people—I don’t think they ever existed. But they know me. I can feel it. I can feel them watching through the paper.
There are eyes in the walls. I used to think it was the depression. That I was unraveling. But they blink. In sync. They’re not mine.
The mirror lied today. It showed me standing still. But I was moving. Only slightly. Just enough to see it. Like he didn’t know I was watching.
The static on the TV started whispering. Not words—locations. Coordinates. I looked one up. It’s just an empty field now. But someone built a door there. No handle. No hinges. Just… a door. Waiting.
Time’s been breaking lately. I’ll lose hours. Then suddenly it’s the same hour again. But I’m not where I was. My hands are dirty. Sometimes wet. I stopped asking why.
There’s a journal I never wrote in. But it has my name on the cover. Inside, it talks about a woman. Faceless. Endless. It says she’s underneath everything. And she wants me to remember her.
Last night, the bed sank. Like someone lay down beside me. I didn’t turn to look. I just… listened. It hummed. Familiar. Like a lullaby I never learned but already feared.
I think I’ve died before. Not metaphorically. I mean I’ve died. Over and over. And something keeps bringing me back. Resetting the same misery. Like it’s feeding off it. Off me.
I walked down the hall today and saw myself waiting at the end. Same clothes. Same skin. But he smiled. And I never smile. I asked what he wanted. He said, “To finish what you started.”
I think I’m not supposed to be awake. Not like this. I’m not supposed to know. Every time I get close, the world twists. Distracts me. Sends someone to knock. Turn on a light. Make me forget again.
But I’m remembering faster now. And she’s getting closer. She doesn’t knock. She bleeds into the air. And when she finally steps through, there won’t be a reset. No loop. Just... her.
This isn’t depression. This isn’t grief. This is infection. I saw her in the flames. She doesn’t bring death. She erases the idea of life itself.
So if you're hearing this, it means I failed again. It means I left the door open.
