Well now, come sit a spell. I've been reading from Matthew chapter 6 verses 25 to 34. That passage is walked with me through every season, still does. Jesus said, don't worry about your life, what you'll eat or where. He wasn't just talking back then, he's speaking right now to you.

00:00:25,748 --> 00:00:54,335
Look at the birds, he said, no barns, no savings, yet the Lord feeds them all. Ever seen a sparrow stressing? Nah, and still they sing. If God cares that much for birds, how much more does he care for you? You're his handiwork, his breath in your lungs, and the lilies, just wildflowers, yet dressed finer than kings.

00:00:54,773 --> 00:01:16,525
Here today, gone tomorrow, still, God clothes them beautifully. Ain't he gonna take care of you too, child? Worry, don't add hours, it steals them. I know, I've tossed and turned over nothing more times than I can count. Most things I feared never even happened.

4
00:01:16,762 --> 00:01:34,447
I remember losing my job once, bills, mouths to feed, thought we were done for, but I hit my knees and somehow we always had enough, not too much, just enough, daily bread like he promised.

5
00:01:34,683 --> 00:02:03,555
See, Jesus wasn't preaching from a palace. He walked the dust, held the broken. He knows struggle. He felt hunger, felt fear. But still, he says, don't worry. He says, seek first the kingdom of God and all these things will be added to you. That's the secret. Eyes on him, not the storm. Keep walking, keep praying.

6
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:27,282
Tomorrow's got its own trouble, but God's already there, working it out. While you're worrying, He's providing. So breathe deep, rest. You're not facing this alone. He's holding your tomorrow and your today. One day, you'll look back and see He was there all along.

7
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:47,312
every step, every burden, every joy. Trust don't mean no storms, just means you don't walk him alone. And one day you'll hear him say, you trusted me, and that was enough. Well done, my child. Well done.
