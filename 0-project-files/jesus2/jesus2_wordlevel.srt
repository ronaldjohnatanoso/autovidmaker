29
00:00:15,028 --> 00:00:15,509
Jesus

30
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:15,788
said,

31
00:00:15,788 --> 00:00:16,550
“Don’t

42
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,207
He

43
00:00:20,207 --> 00:00:20,754
wasn’t

44
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:21,015

159
00:01:14,322 --> 00:01:15,302
Never

160
00:01:15,302 --> 00:01:15,563
even

161
00:01:15,563 --> 00:01:16,762

162
00:01:16,762 --> 00:01:16,962

00:01:19,385 --> 00:01:20,227
Bills,

00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:22,930
for.

177
00:01:23,591 --> 00:01:23,852
But

178
00:01:23,852 --> 00:01:23,992

183
00:01:25,314 --> 00:01:25,714
and

184
00:01:25,714 --> 00:01:26,475
somehow,

185
00:01:26,475 --> 00:01:26,876
we

186
00:01:26,876 --> 00:01:27,356

192
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:30,941
Just

193
00:01:30,941 --> 00:01:31,362

199
00:01:34,683 --> 00:01:35,082
See,

200
00:01:35,082 --> 00:01:35,584

struggle.

216
00:01:42,671 --> 00:01:42,932
He

217
00:01:42,932 --> 00:01:43,272
felt

218
00:01:43,272 --> 00:01:43,632
hunger.

219
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:44,614
Felt

220
00:01:44,614 --> 00:01:45,015
fear.

221
00:01:45,676 --> 00:01:45,855
But

222
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:46,275
still,

223
00:01:46,275 --> 00:01:46,856
He

224
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:47,137
says,

225
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:48,208
“Don’t

226
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:48,698
worry.”

227
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:49,719
He

228
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:49,939
says,

229
00:01:50,441 --> 00:01:50,781
“Seek

230
00:01:50,781 --> 00:01:51,341
first

231
00:01:51,341 --> 00:01:51,581
the

232
00:01:51,581 --> 00:01:52,063
Kingdom

233
00:01:52,063 --> 00:01:52,183
of

234
00:01:52,183 --> 00:01:52,813
God…”

235
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:53,665
“…and

236
00:01:53,665 --> 00:01:53,885
all

237
00:01:53,885 --> 00:01:54,185
these

238
00:01:54,185 --> 00:01:54,706
things’ll

239
00:01:54,706 --> 00:01:54,986
be

240
00:01:54,986 --> 00:01:55,326
added

241
00:01:55,326 --> 00:01:55,527
to

242
00:01:55,527 --> 00:01:55,883
you.”

243
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:56,239
That’s

244
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:56,596
the

245
00:01:56,596 --> 00:01:56,952
secret

246
00:01:56,952 --> 00:01:57,308
—

247
00:01:58,109 --> 00:01:58,409
eyes

248
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:58,569
on

249
00:01:58,569 --> 00:01:58,891
Him,

250
00:01:58,891 --> 00:01:59,712
not

251
00:01:59,712 --> 00:01:59,852
the

252
00:01:59,852 --> 00:02:00,311
storm.

253
00:02:01,132 --> 00:02:01,373
Keep

254
00:02:01,373 --> 00:02:01,774
walkin’.

255
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:02,594
Keep

256
00:02:02,594 --> 00:02:03,446
prayin’.

257
00:02:03,446 --> 00:02:04,358
Tomorrow’s

258
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:04,578
got

259
00:02:04,578 --> 00:02:04,778
its

260
00:02:04,778 --> 00:02:05,018
own

261
00:02:05,018 --> 00:02:05,379
trouble.

262
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:06,180
But

263
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:06,900
God’s

264
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,340
already

265
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:07,661
there,

266
00:02:08,222 --> 00:02:08,622
workin’

267
00:02:08,622 --> 00:02:08,822
it

268
00:02:08,822 --> 00:02:08,962
out.

269
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:10,024
While

270
00:02:10,024 --> 00:02:10,484
you’re

271
00:02:10,484 --> 00:02:10,944
worryin’

272
00:02:10,944 --> 00:02:11,405
—

273
00:02:11,405 --> 00:02:11,865
He’s

274
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:12,325
providin’.

275
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:13,326
So

276
00:02:13,326 --> 00:02:13,828
breathe

277
00:02:13,828 --> 00:02:14,127
deep.

278
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:15,109
Rest.

279
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,009
You’re

280
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:16,289
not

281
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:16,730
facin’

282
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:16,991
this

283
00:02:16,991 --> 00:02:17,391
alone.

284
00:02:17,391 --> 00:02:18,222
He’s

285
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:19,092
holdin’

286
00:02:19,092 --> 00:02:19,354
your

287
00:02:19,354 --> 00:02:19,834
tomorrow.

288
00:02:20,354 --> 00:02:20,495
And

289
00:02:20,495 --> 00:02:20,775

00:02:22,477 --> 00:02:22,757
day,

293
00:02:22,757 --> 00:02:23,578
you’ll

294
00:02:23,578 --> 00:02:23,837
look

295
00:02:23,837 --> 00:02:24,079
back

296
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:24,598
—

297
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:24,799
and

298
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:25,139
see

299
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:25,319
He

300
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:25,599
was

301
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,181
there

302
00:02:26,181 --> 00:02:26,420

Every

305
00:02:28,171 --> 00:02:29,294

306
00:02:29,294 --> 00:02:29,635
Every

307
00:02:29,635 --> 00:02:30,038
burden.

308
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:31,161
Every

309
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:31,742

314
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,391
storms…

315
00:02:34,932 --> 00:02:35,213
just

316
00:02:35,213 --> 00:02:35,555
means

317
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:35,735
you

318
00:02:35,735 --> 00:02:36,016
don’t

319
00:02:36,016 --> 00:02:36,318

322
00:02:37,581 --> 00:02:37,862
And

323
00:02:37,862 --> 00:02:38,062

329
00:02:39,838 --> 00:02:40,611
“You

was

335
00:02:42,777 --> 00:02:43,139
enough.”

336
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:44,364
Well
