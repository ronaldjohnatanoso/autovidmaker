read in a deep voice of an old man
Speaker 1: Well now… come sit a spell. I’ve been readin’ from Matthew chapter six — verses twenty-five to thirty-four. That passage’s walked with me through every season. Still does.
Jesus said, “Don’t worry ‘bout your life — what you’ll eat or wear.” He wasn’t just talkin’ back then. He’s speakin’ right now. To you.
“Look at the birds,” He said. No barns, no savings — yet the Lord feeds ‘em all.
Ever seen a sparrow stressin’? Nah. And still, they sing.
If God cares that much for birds… how much more does He care for you?
You’re His handiwork. His breath in your lungs.
And the lilies? Just wildflowers — yet dressed finer than kings.
Here today, gone tomorrow — still, God clothes ‘em beautifully.
Ain’t He gonna take care of you too, child?
Worry don’t add hours. It steals ‘em. I know. I’ve tossed ‘n turned over nothin’ more times than I can count.
Most things I feared? Never even happened.
I remember losin’ my job once. Bills, mouths to feed. Thought we were done for.
But I hit my knees — and somehow, we always had enough.
Not too much. Just enough. Daily bread, like He promised.
See, Jesus wasn’t preachin’ from a palace. He walked the dust. Held the broken. He knows struggle.
He felt hunger. Felt fear. But still, He says, “Don’t worry.”
He says, “Seek first the Kingdom of God…”
“…and all these things’ll be added to you.”
That’s the secret — eyes on Him, not the storm.
Keep walkin’. Keep prayin’.
Tomorrow’s got its own trouble. But God’s already there, workin’ it out.
While you’re worryin’ — He’s providin’.
So breathe deep. Rest. You’re not facin’ this alone.
He’s holdin’ your tomorrow. And your today.
One day, you’ll look back — and see He was there all along.
Every step. Every burden. Every joy.
Trust don’t mean no storms… just means you don’t walk ‘em alone.
And one day, you’ll hear Him say…
“You trusted Me. And that was enough.”
Well done, My child… well done.
