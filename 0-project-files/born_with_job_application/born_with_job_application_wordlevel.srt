clocked

217
00:01:43,224 --> 00:01:43,385
out,

218
00:01:43,426 --> 00:01:44,206
and

219
00:01:44,227 --> 00:01:44,347
the

220
00:01:44,447 --> 00:01:44,868
world

221
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:45,450
didn't

222
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,090
blink.

223
00:01:47,554 --> 00:01:47,834
Now

224
00:01:47,855 --> 00:01:48,114
you

225
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:48,637
wonder,

226
00:01:48,677 --> 00:01:49,718
what

227
00:01:49,778 --> 00:01:49,938
was

228
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:50,120
I

229
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:50,781
supposed

230
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:50,941
to

231
00:01:51,042 --> 00:01:51,262
do?

232
00:01:51,983 --> 00:01:52,144
What

233
00:01:52,183 --> 00:01:52,304
was

234
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:52,465
I

235
00:01:52,525 --> 00:01:53,006
supposed

236
00:01:53,066 --> 00:01:53,146
to

237
00:01:53,286 --> 00:01:53,686
want

238
00:01:53,706 --> 00:01:54,308
when

239
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:54,748
every

240
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,250
choice

241
00:01:55,269 --> 00:01:55,471
I

242
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:56,572
made

243
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,450
came

244
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,515
prepackaged.

245
00:01:59,879 --> 00:01:59,978
You

246
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:00,239
weren't

247
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:00,962
lazy.

248
00:02:01,563 --> 00:02:01,704
You

249
00:02:01,724 --> 00:02:01,965
weren't

250
00:02:02,105 --> 00:02:02,608
broken.

251
00:02:02,668 --> 00:02:03,349
You

252
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:03,531
were

253
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:04,674
optimized,

254
00:02:05,355 --> 00:02:06,379
streamlined,

255
00:02:06,921 --> 00:02:07,724
automated.

256
00:02:07,763 --> 00:02:08,948
You

257
00:02:08,987 --> 00:02:09,128
were

258
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:09,610
born

259
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,031
into

260
00:02:10,111 --> 00:02:10,132
a

261
00:02:10,312 --> 00:02:10,693

262
00:02:10,813 --> 00:02:11,597
application

263
00:02:11,637 --> 00:02:12,218

264
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:12,318
a

265
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:12,841
face

266
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,622
and

267
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:14,003
now

268
00:02:14,485 --> 00:02:14,665
you're

269
00:02:14,747 --> 00:02:15,007
being

270
00:02:15,087 --> 00:02:16,131
recycled.
