Read this with growing bitterness, like someone realizing too late they’ve lived a life designed by someone else. Start flat, end broken.
Speaker 1: 
You were born into a job application with a face. Pre-approved. Pre-scheduled. Pre-owned.
They gave you a name and a number. They called it a birth certificate. But it looked a lot like a résumé.
You learned to crawl between deadlines. Your first words were slogans.
You said the pledge. But it wasn’t to a flag. It was to a brand. To a bottom line.
They taught you dreams. But only certain kinds. The ones that fit into a quarterly report. The ones you could wear as a badge during your annual review.
You were told to move forward. Always forward. But they never said where to.
So you walked. Into schools that looked like factories. Into jobs that looked like cages. Into apartments stacked like spreadsheets.
The elevator never went to the top. You pressed every button. None of them were yours.
They gave you promotions like tranquilizers. Raises like breadcrumbs. Vacations like brief parole.
One day you looked in the mirror and didn’t recognize the uniform. But it knew you.
You built a life. They gave you templates. Love, as a checkbox. Children, as tax deductions.
And when it ended, they gave you a cake and a handshake. They said, “You made it.” You weren’t sure where.
Even your grave was pre-approved. You clocked out. And the world didn’t blink.
Now you wonder: What was I supposed to do? What was I supposed to want? When every choice I made… came prepackaged?
You weren’t lazy. You weren’t broken. You were optimized. Streamlined. Automated.
You were born into a job application with a face. And now… you’re being recycled.
