voice_instruction: Read this with growing bitterness, like someone realizing too late they’ve lived a life designed by someone else. Start flat, end broken.

Speaker 1:

<p1 image_prompt="towering gray skyscrapers with no windows, stretching endlessly into a grey sky">You were born into a job application with a face. Pre-approved. Pre-scheduled. Pre-owned.</p1>

<p2 image_prompt="hospital room where the baby bassinet has a name tag labeled 'Intern'">They gave you a name and a number. They called it a birth certificate. But it looked a lot like a résumé.</p2>

<p3 image_prompt="a pacifier shaped like a barcode scanner, crib surrounded by corporate logos">You learned to crawl between deadlines. Your first words were slogans.</p3>

<p4 image_prompt="children in a classroom reciting brand names with hands on hearts">You said the pledge. But it wasn’t to a flag. It was to a brand. To a bottom line.</p4>

<p5 image_prompt="row of identical office cubicles, each with a child's drawing taped up: all of them the same drawing">They taught you dreams. But only certain kinds. The ones that fit into a quarterly report. The ones you could wear as a badge during your annual review.</p5>

<p6 image_prompt="man walking on a treadmill that powers a glowing 'PROGRESS' sign, going nowhere">You were told to move forward. Always forward. But they never said where to.</p6>

<p7 image_prompt="person at an office desk, surrounded by clocks with no hands, windows painted with fake skies">So you walked. Into schools that looked like factories. Into jobs that looked like cages. Into apartments stacked like spreadsheets.</p7>

<p8 image_prompt="elevator panel with buttons labeled 'MEDIOCRE', 'EXHAUSTED', 'CONTENT'—but 'FREEDOM' is locked with a key">The elevator never went to the top. You pressed every button. None of them were yours.</p8>

<p9 image_prompt="blank billboard in cityscape with faint text: 'YOU ARE DOING THIS RIGHT' barely visible">They gave you promotions like tranquilizers. Raises like breadcrumbs. Vacations like brief parole.</p9>

<p10 image_prompt="mirror in a corporate bathroom, but the reflection is wearing a suit one size too small, smiling too wide">One day you looked in the mirror and didn’t recognize the uniform. But it knew you.</p10>

<p11 image_prompt="wedding photo where both people are smiling, but the background is a boardroom, and guests are all mannequins">You built a life. They gave you templates. Love, as a checkbox. Children, as tax deductions.</p11>

<p12 image_prompt="retirement party in a sterile room with balloons spelling 'YOU MADE IT', everyone’s faces blurry">And when it ended, they gave you a cake and a handshake. They said, “You made it.” You weren’t sure where.</p12>

<p13 image_prompt="gravestone shaped like a timecard, with a scanner slot instead of a name">Even your grave was pre-approved. You clocked out. And the world didn’t blink.</p13>

<p14 image_prompt="skyline at sunset, all the lights in the skyscrapers turning off in perfect sync, as if exhaling">Now you wonder: What was I supposed to do? What was I supposed to want? When every choice I made… came prepackaged?</p14>

<p15 image_prompt="a single office chair spinning slowly in an empty cubicle farm, papers fluttering">You weren’t lazy. You weren’t broken. You were optimized. Streamlined. Automated.</p15>

<p16 image_prompt="Person standing in the middle of a road that loops back into itself, horizon replaced with another identical road">You were born into a job application with a face. And now… you’re being recycled.</p16>
