00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:16,146
You were born into a job application with a face, pre-approved, pre-scheduled, pre-owned. They gave you a name and a number. They called it a birth certificate, but it looked a lot like a resume.

2
00:00:16,146 --> 00:00:40,277
You learned to crawl between deadlines. Your first words were slogans. You said the pledge, but it wasn't to a flag. It was to a brand, to a bottom line. They taught you dreams, but only certain kinds. The ones that fit into a quarterly report. The ones you could wear as a badge during your annual review.

3
00:00:40,277 --> 00:01:01,439
You were told to move forward, always forward, but they never said where to. So you walked into schools that look like factories, into jobs that look like cages, into apartments stacked like spreadsheets. The elevator never went to the top. You pressed every button.

4
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:19,748
None of them were yours. They gave you promotions like tranquilizers, raises like breadcrumbs, vacations like brief parole. One day you looked in the mirror and didn't recognize the uniform, but it knew you.

5
00:01:19,748 --> 00:01:38,361
You built a life. They gave you templates, love as a checkbox, children as tax deductions. And when it ended, they gave you a cake and a handshake. They said, you made it. You weren't sure where.

6
00:01:39,677 --> 00:01:56,552
Even your grave was pre-approved, you clocked out, and the world didn't blink. Now you wonder, what was I supposed to do? What was I supposed to want when every choice I made

7
00:01:57,109 --> 00:02:16,110
came prepackaged. You weren't lazy. You weren't broken. You were optimized, streamlined, automated. You were born into a job application with a face and now you're being recycled.
