00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:19,234
Look at you, child of the Most High. You are fearfully and wonderfully made. The same God who spoke galaxies into existence breathed life into your lungs. You carry the DNA of divinity, blessed soul.

2
00:00:19,234 --> 00:00:36,109
When storms rage in your life, remember you serve the God who commands the winds and waves. Every trial is training. Every test is testimony. Your breakthrough is brewing. Hallelujah!

3
00:00:36,615 --> 00:00:52,984
The King of Kings died so you could live abundantly. His sacrifice wasn't just for forgiveness, it was for your freedom, your favor, your future. You're not just saved, you're chosen.

4
00:00:53,119 --> 00:01:13,234
From five loaves and two fish he fed thousands. Your little is much when God is in it. He's about to multiply your gifts, your resources, your impact. Get ready for overflow. Prayer changes everything.

5
00:01:13,234 --> 00:01:26,531
When you pray, heaven moves. Angels are dispatched. Miracles are released. You're not just talking to yourself. You're talking to the creator of the universe.

6
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:46,006
He opens blind eyes. He makes the lame walk. He turns water into wine. The same Jesus who performed miracles two thousand years ago is still working today. Your miracle is on the way.

7
00:01:46,158 --> 00:02:13,933
You are precious in his sight, more valuable than gold. The god of the universe knows your name, counts your tears, and has plans to prosper you. You matter to the king. He conquered death, hell, and the grave. Because he lives, you can face tomorrow. Your future is secure in him.

8
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:34,032
Death has no sting. Grave has no victory. He's knocking at your heart's door, not forcing his way in, but lovingly inviting. Open up to the one who loves you unconditionally. Let him transform your life.

9
00:02:34,521 --> 00:03:00,457
You're not lost anymore. The Good Shepherd found you. He guides you, protects you, provides for you. In his presence is fullness of joy. The King served. He showed us true greatness comes through serving others. Your calling is to love like he loved, serve like he served.

10
00:03:00,457 --> 00:03:17,653
You're destined for greatness. Even in his darkest hour, he trusted the Father's plan. Your pain has purpose. Your struggle has significance. God's using it all for your good.

11
00:03:17,653 --> 00:03:45,969
It is finished. The victory is won. Sin defeated. Death conquered. You're more than a conqueror through Christ. Walk in that victory. He's equipped you with power from on high. You're not going out empty handed. The same spirit that raised Christ from the dead lives in you. Go change the world.

12
00:03:46,492 --> 00:04:13,290
He's coming back. This world is not your home. Keep your eyes on the prize. Your citizenship is in heaven. What a day that will be. Right now, at this very moment, Jesus is interceding for you, praying for you, fighting for you. You have an advocate with the Father.

13
00:04:13,578 --> 00:04:42,637
No matter how far you've wandered, his arms are open wide. The father is running toward you. You're not an orphan. You're a child of the king. He speaks peace to your storm. What looks impossible to you is possible with God. Mountains move when faith speaks. Your situation is about to change.

14
00:04:42,637 --> 00:05:09,367
One day, every knee will bow, every tongue will confess, he is Lord of Lords and King of Kings, and you get to reign with him. What a privilege! Live for his approval. One day you'll hear those beautiful words, well done, good and faithful servant.

15
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:16,471
Your labor in the Lord is not in vain. Keep pressing, blessed child of God.
