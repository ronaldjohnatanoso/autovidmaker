THEATRICAL AND INCREASINGLY UNHINGED FOR SPEAKER 1, DEADPAN RATIONAL FOR SPEAKER 2
Speaker 1: 
THEY’RE WATCHING US. ALWAYS WATCHING.
PIGEONS ARE GOVERNMENT DRONES. EVERY FLAP? A SIGNAL. EVERY COO? A CODE.
Speaker 2: 
No. Pigeons have organs, bones, digestive systems. They're birds. Actual birds. You can dissect one.
Speaker 1: 
THAT’S EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO THINK. LOOK AT THIS IMAGE. ENHANCE!
THIS ONE HAD A WIRE IN ITS LEG. YOU THINK THAT’S NATURAL? HUH? A WIRE?
I’VE BEEN TRACKING THEM FOR WEEKS. THEY FOLLOW ME. TO THE GROCERY STORE. TO THE SHOWER.
Speaker 2: 
Have you considered they’re just attracted to bread? You eat a lot of carbs, don’t you?
Real scientists tag birds for migration studies. With GPS. Not espionage. This is science, not 'Mission: Im-peck-able.'
Speaker 1: 
THAT’S WHAT MAKES THEM PERFECT SPIES. NO ONE SUSPECTS THE PIGEON.
AND I FOUND THIS—STRAIGHT FROM THE DEEP WEB. CODE NAME: PROJECT FEATHERWATCH.
Speaker 2: 
That's a fake document printed on the back of a Taco Bell receipt.
They're just... birds. Some of them don’t even blink right. One pooped on my laptop yesterday. Spy tech doesn’t do that.
Speaker 1: 
THAT’S JUST WHAT A SPY WOULD DO TO THROW YOU OFF.
OPEN YOUR EYES. THE FEATHERS, THE EYES, THE METALLIC GLINT IN THE BEAKS. I’VE CONNECTED THE DOTS. THEY REPORT BACK TO A CENTRAL PIGEON SERVER—PROBABLY IN OHIO.
Speaker 2: 
...So your theory is: the government created birds to replace real birds… just to watch you buy frozen pizzas at 3 AM?
I’m not even sure you’re arguing anymore. I think you just need a nap.
Speaker 1: 
NOBODY NAPS UNTIL THE TRUTH IS COOKED AND SERVED. WAKE UP, SHEEPLE. THE BIRDS ARE BUGGED.
FIRST THEY CAME FOR THE SEED, THEN THEY CAME FOR OUR FREEDOM.
