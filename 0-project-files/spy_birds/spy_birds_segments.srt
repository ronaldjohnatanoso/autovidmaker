They're watching us, always watching. Pigeons are government drones. Every flap, a signal, every coup, a code. No, pigeons have organs, bones, digestive systems. They're birds, actual birds. You can dissect one.

That's exactly what they want you to think. Look at this image. Enhance. This one had a wire in its leg. You think that's natural, huh? A wire? I've been tracking them for weeks. They follow me to the grocery store, to the shower. Have you considered they're just attracted to bread? You eat a lot of carbs, don't you?

Real scientists tag birds for migration studies with GPS, not espionage. This is science, not mission impeccable. That's what makes them perfect spies. No one suspects the pigeon. And I found this straight from the deep web. Codename Project Featherwatch.

That's a fake document printed on the back of a Taco Bell receipt. They're just birds. Some of them don't even blink right. One pooped on my laptop yesterday. Spy tech doesn't do that. That's just what a spy would do to throw you off. Open your eyes, the feathers, the eyes, the metallic glint in the beaks. I've connected the dots. They report back to a central pigeon server, probably in Ohio.

So your theory is the government created birds to replace real birds just to watch you buy frozen pizzas at 3 a.m.? I'm not even sure you're arguing anymore. I think you just need a nap. Nobody naps until the truth is cooked and served. Wake up, sheeple. The birds are bugged. First they came for the seed, then they came for our freedom.
