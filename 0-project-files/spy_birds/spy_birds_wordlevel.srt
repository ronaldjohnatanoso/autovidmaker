3
00:00:01,072 --> 00:00:01,272
us,

4
00:00:01,994 --> 00:00:02,494
always

5
00:00:02,513 --> 00:00:03,134
watching.

6
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:04,136
Pigeons

7
00:00:04,155 --> 00:00:04,577

10
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:06,820
Every

25
00:00:16,071 --> 00:00:16,271
They're

26
00:00:16,312 --> 00:00:16,693

27
00:00:16,992 --> 00:00:17,434
actual

28
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:17,954

29
00:00:18,414 --> 00:00:18,535
You

30
00:00:18,574 --> 00:00:18,714
can

31
00:00:18,754 --> 00:00:19,175
dissect

32
00:00:19,376 --> 00:00:19,996
one.

33
00:00:19,977 --> 00:00:20,378
That's

34
00:00:20,557 --> 00:00:21,158
exactly

35
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:21,338

00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:22,981
Look

42
00:00:23,021 --> 00:00:23,082

You

55
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:28,510
think

56
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:28,751
that's

57
00:00:28,812 --> 00:00:29,213
natural,

58
00:00:29,413 --> 00:00:29,593
huh?

59
00:00:29,934 --> 00:00:29,974
A

67
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:33,118
They

68
00:00:33,198 --> 00:00:33,539

real

217
00:01:40,647 --> 00:01:41,088
birds

218
00:01:41,629 --> 00:01:41,849
just

219
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:41,990
to

220
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:42,350
watch

221
00:01:42,412 --> 00:01:42,552
you

222
00:01:42,632 --> 00:01:42,873
buy

223
00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:43,313
frozen

224
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:43,834
pizzas

225
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:44,135
at

226
00:01:44,156 --> 00:01:44,176
3

227
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:44,977
a.m.?

228
00:01:45,838 --> 00:01:46,019
I'm

229
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:46,219
not

230
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:46,460
even

231
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:46,721
sure

232
00:01:46,781 --> 00:01:47,001
you're

233
00:01:47,162 --> 00:01:47,563
arguing

234
00:01:47,623 --> 00:01:48,064
anymore.

235
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:48,646
I

236
00:01:48,686 --> 00:01:48,846
think

237
00:01:48,885 --> 00:01:49,027
you

238
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:49,227
just

239
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:49,427
need

240
00:01:49,487 --> 00:01:49,507
a

241
00:01:49,628 --> 00:01:50,671
nap.

242
00:01:50,691 --> 00:01:51,171
Nobody

243
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:51,692
naps

244
00:01:51,793 --> 00:01:52,093
until

245
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:52,254
the

246
00:01:52,353 --> 00:01:52,715
truth

247
00:01:52,956 --> 00:01:53,036
is

248
00:01:53,215 --> 00:01:53,496
cooked

249
00:01:53,677 --> 00:01:53,778
and

250
00:01:53,957 --> 00:01:54,478
served.

251
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,361
Wake

252
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:55,581
up,

253
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:56,143
sheeple.

254
00:01:56,524 --> 00:01:56,644
The

255
00:01:56,724 --> 00:01:57,204
birds

256
00:01:57,486 --> 00:01:57,605
are

257
00:01:57,787 --> 00:01:58,248
bugged.

258
00:01:58,948 --> 00:01:59,189
First

259
00:01:59,250 --> 00:01:59,390
they

260
00:01:59,430 --> 00:01:59,611
came

261
00:01:59,671 --> 00:01:59,771
for

262
00:01:59,811 --> 00:01:59,891
the

263
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:00,352
seed,

264
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:00,953
then

265
00:02:01,013 --> 00:02:01,155
they

266
00:02:01,215 --> 00:02:01,454
came

267
00:02:01,515 --> 00:02:01,676
for

268
00:02:01,756 --> 00:02:01,876
our

269
00:02:01,995 --> 00:02:02,697
freedom.
