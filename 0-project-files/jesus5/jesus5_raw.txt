read in a deep voice of an old man
Speaker 1: Listen to me — I'm about to tell you 'bout the day death itself got defeated. The day a dead man walked out of his grave. This ain't no fairy tale, child. This happened.
Jesus got word that His friend Lazarus was sick. Real sick. Sisters Mary and Martha sent word — "Come quick, Lord."
But Jesus? He stayed put. Two more days. Can you imagine? Your friend's dyin' and you wait?
Finally said, "Let's go to Judea." Disciples thought He'd lost His mind. "They tried to stone You there, Master!"
But Jesus said, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep. I'm goin' to wake him up."
By the time they got there, Lazarus had been dead four days. Four days! Body was already decayin'.
Martha ran to Jesus, cryin', "Lord, if You'd been here, my brother wouldn't have died!"
Jesus said, "Your brother will rise again." She thought He meant someday, at the resurrection.
"Martha," He said, "I AM the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in Me will live, even though he dies."
Then He asked the question that'll shake your soul: "Do you believe this?"
Mary came next, fell at His feet, same words: "Lord, if You'd been here..."
When Jesus saw her cryin', saw all them folks weepin' — the Bible says He was deeply moved.
Then comes the shortest verse in Scripture: "Jesus wept."
Folks said, "See how He loved him!" But others grumbled, "Couldn't He have prevented this?"
Jesus came to the tomb — a cave with a stone rolled across it.
"Take away the stone," He said. Martha panicked — "Lord, by now there's a bad odor!"
But Jesus looked up and prayed, "Father, I thank You that You have heard Me."
Then He cried out with a loud voice that shook the earth: "LAZARUS, COME OUT!"
And friend — I get chills every time — out walked a dead man. Still wrapped in burial clothes.
The crowd gasped. Some fell on their faces. Death had just been conquered!
"Take off the grave clothes," Jesus said, calm as you please. "Let him go."
There stood Lazarus — alive, breathin', huggin' his sisters. Four days dead, now walkin' around!
Some folks believed that day. Others? Started plottin' to kill Jesus. Truth divides, always has.
But here's what I want you to hear — Jesus didn't just raise Lazarus. He said, "I AM the resurrection."
Maybe you feel dead inside. Bound up by sin, addiction, despair.
Same Jesus who called Lazarus is callin' you: "Come out of that darkness!"
He's got power over every kind of death — spiritual, emotional, eternal.
If you believe Jesus has power over death itself, type AMEN right now.
And subscribe if you want to keep hearin' about the God who brings dead things back to life.
