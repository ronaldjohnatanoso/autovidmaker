was

218
00:01:26,358 --> 00:01:26,840
deeply

219
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,801
moved.

220
00:01:27,781 --> 00:01:28,121
Then

221
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:28,403
comes

222
00:01:28,403 --> 00:01:28,563

223
00:01:28,563 --> 00:01:29,046
shortest

224
00:01:29,046 --> 00:01:29,367
verse

225
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:29,507
in

226
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:30,230
Scripture:

227
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:30,953
"Jesus

228
00:01:30,953 --> 00:01:31,676
wept."

229
00:01:32,237 --> 00:01:32,519
Folks

230
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:33,061
said,

231
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:33,281
"See

He

234
00:01:33,664 --> 00:01:33,984
loved

236
00:01:34,546 --> 00:01:34,768
But

237
00:01:34,768 --> 00:01:35,069
others

238
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:35,772
grumbled,

00:01:35,772 --> 00:01:36,112
"Couldn't

244
00:01:38,108 --> 00:01:38,688
Jesus

245
00:01:38,688 --> 00:01:39,009
came

246
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:39,170
to

247
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:39,310
the

stone

255
00:01:41,474 --> 00:01:41,853
rolled

256
00:01:41,853 --> 00:01:42,295
across

257
00:01:42,295 --> 00:01:42,355
it.

00:01:42,896 --> 00:01:44,018
"Take

said.

264
00:01:44,978 --> 00:01:45,960
Martha

265
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,341
panicked

266
00:01:46,341 --> 00:01:46,722

267
00:01:46,722 --> 00:01:47,183
"Lord,

But

275
00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:49,787
Jesus

276
00:01:49,787 --> 00:01:50,108
looked

277
00:01:50,108 --> 00:01:50,248
up

Then

290
00:01:54,454 --> 00:01:54,655
He

291
00:01:54,655 --> 00:01:55,176

out

314
00:02:04,213 --> 00:02:04,734

00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:38,676
didn't

391
00:02:38,676 --> 00:02:39,016
