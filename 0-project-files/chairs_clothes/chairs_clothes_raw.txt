SPEAKER 1 – UNYIELDING BELIEF IN THE ABSURD. SPEAKER 2 – CALMLY DROWNING IN EXISTENTIAL REGRET.
Speaker 1: 
LOOK AT IT. A CHAIR. BUT WHAT IS A CHAIR, REALLY?
IT’S JUST CLOTHING FOR THE FLOOR. A LITTLE OUTFIT. A GROUND JACKET. A BOTTOM COAT.
Speaker 2: 
No, it’s a tool. A piece of furniture. Designed to support the human body.
It’s not… clothing. For the floor. The floor doesn’t wear anything.
Speaker 1: 
EVERY ROOM HAS A FLOOR. EVERY FLOOR HAS CHAIRS. THEY’RE ACCESSORIES. THEY COMPLETE THE OUTFIT.
AND RUGS? RUGS ARE JUST SOCKS FOR HOUSES. THE EVIDENCE IS ALL AROUND US.
Speaker 2: 
You’ve been in this IKEA for six hours. Please leave.
Chairs are not... expressive statements made by the Earth. They’re not sentient pajamas for tile.
Speaker 1: 
OBJECTION! IF A HAT CAN BE CLOTHING FOR THE HEAD—WHY NOT A CHAIR FOR THE FLOOR’S BUTT?
THE FLOOR IS SHY. THE CHAIR IS ITS COMFORT BLANKET.
Speaker 2: 
That’s not even... anatomically consistent. Floors don’t have butts.
This logic ends with you putting pants on a countertop. Or giving your salad a couch.
Speaker 1: 
CHAIRS ARE OUR GREATEST INVENTION. THE FIRST TIME SOMEONE REFUSED TO SIT ON DIRT… THAT WAS FASHION. PRIMAL. BOLD.
THE CHAIR HAS EVOLVED, ADAPTED. FROM STONE TO MEMORY FOAM. A LUXURY LINE FOR TERRAIN.
Speaker 2: 
I’m not paid enough to argue with someone who thinks recliners are seasonal accessories for laminate.
You know what? Fine. Floors wear chairs. Do floors also wear tables? Nightstands? The fridge?
Speaker 1: 
YES! THE FRIDGE IS A STATEMENT PIECE. THE HOUSE’S CROWN JEWEL. KITCHENS ARE THE RED CARPET.
EVERY ROOM IS STRUTTING. EVERY WALL IS WATCHING. THE GROUND IS SERVING LOOKS.
