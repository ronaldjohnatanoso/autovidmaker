Come close friend, got something to tell you about shepherds. Been one myself back in the day. Jesus knew what he was talking about in John 10. He said, I am the good shepherd, not just any shepherd, the good one. Real shepherds don't climb over walls like thieves, they come through the gate proper like.

2
00:00:26,524 --> 00:00:54,689
And the sheep, they know their shepherd's voice, not just the words, the heart behind them. He calls each one by name, daisy, woolly, stubborn peep. Every sheep matters. When he leads, they follow, not because they have to, because they trust where he's going. But a stranger, they scatter. Sheep ain't stupid, they know danger.

3
00:00:55,802 --> 00:01:20,186
Folks didn't understand his story, so Jesus made it plain. He said, I am the gate for the sheep. Whoever enters through me will be saved. Before him came thieves and robbers, wolves in sheep's clothing. Hired hands run when trouble comes. It ain't their sheep. Why should they care?

4
00:01:20,575 --> 00:01:46,917
But the good shepherd, he stays, fights, dies if he has to. I've seen it, shepherds torn up by wild beasts protecting what was theirs. Jesus said, I laid down my life for the sheep, knew what was coming. Nobody took his life, he gave it for you, for me, for every lost lamb.

5
00:01:47,677 --> 00:02:04,719
But death couldn't hold the good shepherd. He took his life back up. He's got other sheep too, not just our flock. All colors, all kinds. One day, one flock, one shepherd. That's the plan.

6
00:02:04,888 --> 00:02:31,854
Maybe you're that lost sheep tonight, wandering in the thorns. He's out there looking for you, calling your name. Won't stop till it finds you. Won't leave you behind. That's what good shepherds do. They bring the lost ones home. His voice cuts through all the noise, all the lies, all the fear. Listen close. Can you hear him calling?

7
00:02:32,344 --> 00:02:38,992
The gate's still open, friend. The Good Shepherd's waiting. Time to come home to the fold.
