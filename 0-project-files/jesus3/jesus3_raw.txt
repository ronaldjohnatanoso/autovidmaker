read in a deep voice of an old man
Speaker 1: Come close, friend. Got somethin' to tell ya 'bout shepherds. Been one myself, back in the day. Jesus knew what He was talkin' about in John ten.
He said, "I am the Good Shepherd." Not just any shepherd — the Good one.
Real shepherds don't climb over walls like thieves. They come through the gate, proper-like.
And the sheep? They know their shepherd's voice. Not just the words — the heart behind 'em.
He calls each one by name. Daisy, Woolly, Stubborn Pete. Every sheep matters.
When he leads, they follow. Not 'cause they have to — 'cause they trust where he's goin'.
But a stranger? They scatter. Sheep ain't stupid — they know danger.
Folks didn't understand His story. So Jesus made it plain.
He said, "I am the gate for the sheep. Whoever enters through Me will be saved."
Before Him came thieves and robbers — wolves in sheep's clothing.
Hired hands run when trouble comes. It ain't their sheep — why should they care?
But the Good Shepherd? He stays. Fights. Dies if he has to.
I've seen it. Shepherds torn up by wild beasts, protectin' what was theirs.
Jesus said, "I lay down My life for the sheep." Knew what was comin'.
Nobody took His life — He gave it. For you. For me. For every lost lamb.
But death couldn't hold the Good Shepherd. He took His life back up.
He's got other sheep too — not just our flock. All colors, all kinds.
One day, one flock, one Shepherd. That's the plan.
Maybe you're that lost sheep tonight. Wanderin' in the thorns.
He's out there lookin' for you. Callin' your name.
Won't stop 'til He finds you. Won't leave you behind.
That's what Good Shepherds do — they bring the lost ones home.
His voice cuts through all the noise. All the lies. All the fear.
Listen close — can you hear Him callin'?
The gate's still open, friend. The Good Shepherd's waitin'.
Time to come home to the fold.
