<p4 image_prompt="empty fridge, user drinking tap water with protein powder">You so broke you out here makin’ struggle smoothies. Tap water and vibes, talkin’ bout “bulking season.” Bulking for what? You ain’t even lifting responsibility, dog-ass n***a.</p4>

<p9 image_prompt="mirror shows self saying 'we gon' get it soon', 8 months later same reflection">Every morning you give yourself that little pep talk — “we gon’ get it.” Bro, it’s June. You been gon’ get it since January. Lying to yourself with confidence. Narcissist with no achievements.</p9>

<p12 image_prompt="calendar with motivational quotes but no events">Your calendar say “grind hard, shine later” but all you done this month is smoke and play 2K. You ain’t grinding, you glitchin’. You livin’ like a side quest character in GTA.</p12>

<p17 image_prompt="girl asks 'so what do you do?' you reply 'I'm working on me'">Shorty asked what you do and you said “I’m working on me.” Nah. You workin’ on nothing. You unemployed with a self-care routine and no self-respect. Get off them crystals and fill out a W-2, n*a.**</p17>
