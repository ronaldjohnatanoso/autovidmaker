read with an angry hood accent
Speaker 1: Boy, look at you. Just look at you. Ain’t got no job, no money, no bitches, no drive — just vibes and body odor. You sittin' in the same crusty ass boxers, smellin’ like broken promises and hot Cheeto dust. Bum ass n**a.*
You out here double tappin’ baddies with a -$17 bank account. No hoes, no dough, no goals. N***a, you a financial ghost. A broke-ass spirit. You scaring your own money away.
You out here Googlin’ “jobs that pay hella but don’t require effort.” Bro. You ain’t lookin’ for employment, you lookin’ for a miracle. Get yo lazy, shortcut-searchin’, can’t-read-the-fine-print ass off my Wi-Fi.
You so broke you out here makin’ struggle smoothies. Tap water and vibes, talkin’ bout “bulking season.” Bulking for what? You ain’t even lifting responsibility, dog-ass n***a.
Your resume look like it was typed by a drunk possum. Spelled “professional” as “profeshional.” N***a, even autocorrect gave up on you. You got ChatGPT and still sound like a dropout. Dusty keyboard-using ass.
All your homies bossin’ up and here you go, the designated “yo that’s lit” friend. You everybody’s cheerleader ‘cause you ain’t got no motion. You clappin’ at other folks’ success like that’s your LinkedIn endorsement. No path-having ass.
Boy you sittin' there tryin' to manifest money with incense and vibes. N***a you need to manifest a schedule. Ain’t no vision board saving you from poverty. That’s not the law of attraction, that’s the law of ain’t shit.
You tryin’ to finesse the system but can’t even finesse a basic sentence. You lied on your resume and still ain’t get hired. Even the lies weren’t convincing. You a fraud and a failure, n**a.*
Every morning you give yourself that little pep talk — “we gon’ get it.” Bro, it’s June. You been gon’ get it since January. Lying to yourself with confidence. Narcissist with no achievements.
You out here tellin' shorties you “between jobs” like that sound sexy. Boy you been between jobs for two damn years. What you between? Hope and depression? No hoes gettin’ ass n**a.*
A recruiter slid in your inbox and you left them on read like you the catch. Boy, you unemployed. You ain't playin' hard to get, you just hard to employ. You allergic to opportunity, dumb-ass n***a.
Your calendar say “grind hard, shine later” but all you done this month is smoke and play 2K. You ain’t grinding, you glitchin’. You livin’ like a side quest character in GTA.
You out here musty, unemployed, and still somehow cocky. No deodorant. No income. Maximum ego. N***a, you stank AND broke. That’s a federal crime.
You got asked what motivates you and you said “hunger.” Boy if you don’t shut yo poetic, starving-artist, ramen-powered-ass up. Motivation ain’t enough. Get skills, dummy.
You wrote “self-taught visionary” on your resume like that mean somethin’. You not a visionary. You just unemployed with Wi-Fi and ideas that don’t pay rent. Hallucinating success-having ass.
You watching people quit jobs you ain’t even qualified to apply for. N***a, you ain’t stuck in the matrix — you never logged in. You a background character in your own life.
Shorty asked what you do and you said “I’m working on me.” Nah. You workin’ on nothing. You unemployed with a self-care routine and no self-respect. Get off them crystals and fill out a W-2, n*a.**
You left sticky notes with motivational quotes like that’s gonna change your situation. You motivational, but broke. You inspirational, but useless. You broke Gandhi-ass n**a.*
The version of you who got it together? He disgusted. He lookin’ at you like “Damn, bro. You still here? Still broke? Still blamin’ capitalism when you can’t even spell resume?”
I ain’t even mad no more. I’m just disappointed. You could’ve been something. But you’d rather scroll, smoke, and pretend. So keep playin’, no-job-havin’, no-hoes-gettin’, no-goal-settin’ bum-ass n*a**. The world movin’. And you? You still on pause.
