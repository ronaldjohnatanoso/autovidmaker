00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:27,149
Boy, look at you. Just look at you. Ain't got no job, no money, no bitches, no drive, just vibes and body odor. You sittin' in the same crusty-ass boxes, smellin' like broken promises and hot Cheeto dust. Bum-ass nigga. You out here double-tappin' baddies with a minus-seventeen-dollar bank account. No hoes, no dough, no goals. Nigga, you a financial ghost. A broke-ass spirit. You scarein' your own money away.

2
00:00:27,419 --> 00:00:51,719
You out here googling, jobs that pay hella but don't require effort. Bro, you ain't looking for employment, you looking for a miracle. Get your lazy shortcut searching, can't read the fine print ass off my wifi. You so broke, you out here making struggle smoothies, tap water and vibes, talking about bulking season, bulking for what? You ain't even lifting responsibility, dog ass nigga.

3
00:00:51,820 --> 00:01:20,692
Your resume looked like it was typed by a drunk possum, spelled professional as professional. Nigga even autocorrect gave up on you. You got chat GPT and still sound like a dropout, dusty keyboard using ass. All your homies bossing up and here you go, the designated yo that's lit friend. You everybody's cheerleader, cause you ain't got no motion. You clapping at other folks success like that's your LinkedIn endorsement. No path having ass.

4
00:01:20,692 --> 00:01:45,027
Boy, you sitting there trying to manifest money with incense and vibes. Nigga, you need to manifest the schedule. Ain't no vision boy saving you from poverty. That's not the law of attraction. That's the law of ain't shit. You trying to finesse the system, but can't even finesse a basic sentence. You lied on your resume and still ain't get hired. Even the lies weren't convincing. You a fraud and a failure, nigga.

5
00:01:45,465 --> 00:02:10,457
Every morning, you give yourself that little pep talk. We gon' get it. Bro, it's June. You been gon' get it since January. Lying to yourself with confidence. Narcissist with no achievements. You out here telling shorties, you between jobs, like that sounds sexy. Boy, you been between jobs for two damn years. What you between? Hope and depression? No hoes getting ass, nigga.

6
00:02:10,913 --> 00:02:35,500
A recruiter slid in your inbox, and you left them on red like you to catch. Boy, you unemployed. You ain't playin' hard to get, you just hard to employ. You allergic to opportunity, dumbass nigga. Your calendar say, grind hard, shine later, but all you done this money smokin' play 2K. You ain't grindin', you glitchin'. You livin' like a side quest character in GTA.

7
00:02:35,703 --> 00:02:58,788
You out here musty, unemployed, and still somehow cocky. No deodorant, no income, maximum ego. Nigga, you stink and broke. That's a federal crime. You gotta ask what motivates you, and you said hunger. Boy, if you don't shut your poetic, starving artist, ramen-powered ass up, motivation ain't enough. Get skills, dummy.

8
00:02:59,328 --> 00:03:12,034
You wrote self-taught visionary on your resume like that means something. You're not a visionary. You just unemployed with wifi and ideas that don't pay rent. Hallucinating success, have an ass.

9
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:35,812
You watchin' people quit jobs you ain't even qualified to apply for. Nigga, you ain't stuck in the matrix. You never logged in. You a background character in your own life. Shorty asked what you do, and you said, I'm workin' on me. Nah, you workin' on nothin'. You unemployed with a self-care routine and no self-respect. Get off them crystals and fill out a W-2, nigga.

10
00:03:36,367 --> 00:04:00,162
You left sticky notes with motivational quotes like that's gonna change your situation. You motivational, but broke. You inspirational, but useless. You broke ass Gandhi ass nigga. The version of you that got it together, he disgusted. He looking at you like, damn bro, you still here? Still broke? Still blaming capitalism when you can't even spell resume?

11
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:17,358
I ain't even mad no more. I'm just disappointed. You could've been something, but you'd rather scroll, smoke, and pretend. So keep playin', no job havin', no hoes gettin', no goals settin', bum-ass nigga. The world movin', and you, you still on pause.
