You're

2
00:00:00,637 --> 00:00:00,978
not

3
00:00:00,978 --> 00:00:01,859
graduating

4
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:02,119
this

5
00:00:02,119 --> 00:00:02,439
year.

6
00:00:02,439 --> 00:00:03,060
And

7
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:03,439
deep

8
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:04,020
down,

9
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:04,200
you

10
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:04,480
knew

11
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:04,681
that.

12
00:00:05,362 --> 00:00:05,661
Let's

13
00:00:05,661 --> 00:00:05,881
not

14
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:06,423

15
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:06,682
this

16
00:00:06,682 --> 00:00:06,863
was

17
00:00:06,863 --> 00:00:07,224
some

18
00:00:07,224 --> 00:00:07,844
twist

19
00:00:07,844 --> 00:00:08,265
ending.

20
00:00:08,265 --> 00:00:08,865
This

21
00:00:08,865 --> 00:00:09,005
was

22
00:00:09,005 --> 00:00:09,766
always

23
00:00:09,766 --> 00:00:10,066
the

25
00:00:11,266 --> 00:00:11,428
What

26
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:11,628

00:00:11,747 --> 00:00:12,227
even

29
00:00:12,227 --> 00:00:12,609

36
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:16,032
soft

37
00:00:16,032 --> 00:00:16,512

00:00:17,033 --> 00:00:17,533
Watching

a

45
00:00:20,635 --> 00:00:21,297
strategy.

46
00:00:21,297 --> 00:00:22,478
You

47
00:00:22,478 --> 00:00:22,978

51
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,001
LOL.

52
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:26,661
The

even

56
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:28,884
hard.

57
00:00:28,884 --> 00:00:29,204
Just

58
00:00:29,204 --> 00:00:29,966

Let's

102
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:49,890
be

103
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:50,290
honest.

00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:53,875
you'd

114
00:00:56,218 --> 00:00:56,779
Instead,

we

118
00:00:58,384 --> 00:00:59,106
mumbling

coherence.

128
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:03,432
And

129
00:01:03,432 --> 00:01:03,671
don't

130
00:01:03,671 --> 00:01:03,912

00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:11,141
crashed.

148
00:01:11,683 --> 00:01:11,903
It

164
00:01:18,893 --> 00:01:19,112
Not

165
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:19,534

00:01:19,534 --> 00:01:19,853
they

00:01:19,853 --> 00:01:20,674
forgot,

168
00:01:20,674 --> 00:01:20,855
but

169
00:01:20,855 --> 00:01:21,256
because

170
00:01:21,256 --> 00:01:21,637
you

171
00:01:21,637 --> 00:01:21,977

But

182
00:01:25,902 --> 00:01:26,632
hey,

183
00:01:26,632 --> 00:01:27,353
Failure

184

right?

187
00:01:29,475 --> 00:01:29,736
You'll

188
00:01:29,736 --> 00:01:29,936
be

189
00:01:29,936 --> 00:01:30,436

190
00:01:30,436 --> 00:01:31,117
interesting

00:01:35,944 --> 00:01:36,463
yourself

201
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:36,743
you'd

00:01:37,144 --> 00:01:37,885

204
00:01:37,885 --> 00:01:38,266
Start

it's

00:01:42,911 --> 00:01:43,731
May.

215
00:01:43,731 --> 00:01:44,033
You're

217
00:01:44,694 --> 00:01:45,974
revising.

218
00:01:45,974 --> 00:01:46,415
Whatever

219
00:01:46,415 --> 00:01:46,796
that

220
00:01:46,796 --> 00:01:47,176
means

221
00:01:47,176 --> 00:01:47,537
now.

222
00:01:48,337 --> 00:01:49,118
Productivity

223
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:49,498
hacks

224
00:01:49,498 --> 00:01:49,879
won't

225
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:50,260
save

226
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:50,439
you.

227
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,400
Neither

228
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:51,700
will

229
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,537
coffee.

230
00:01:52,537 --> 00:01:53,397
Pomodoro

231
00:01:53,397 --> 00:01:54,319
timers,

232
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:54,459
or

233
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:54,780
that

234
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:54,920
one

235
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,680
YouTuber

236
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:55,900
who

237
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,361
yells

238
00:01:56,361 --> 00:01:56,460
at

239
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:56,721
you

240
00:01:56,721 --> 00:01:56,962
to

241
00:01:56,962 --> 00:01:57,563
grind

242
00:01:57,563 --> 00:01:57,802
while

243
00:01:57,802 --> 00:01:58,043
you

244
00:01:58,043 --> 00:01:58,403
cry

245
00:01:58,403 --> 00:01:58,683
into

246
00:01:58,683 --> 00:01:58,944
your

247
00:01:58,944 --> 00:01:59,325
ramen.

248
00:02:00,146 --> 00:02:00,486
Here's

249
00:02:00,486 --> 00:02:00,646
the

250
00:02:00,646 --> 00:02:01,087
part

251
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:01,367
no

252
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:01,626
one

253
00:02:01,626 --> 00:02:02,128
says

254
00:02:02,128 --> 00:02:02,347
out

255
00:02:02,347 --> 00:02:02,707
loud.

256
00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:03,769
Maybe

257
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:04,090
this

258
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:04,530
just

259
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:04,891
isn't

260
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:05,230
for

261
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:05,492
you.

262
00:02:06,191 --> 00:02:06,472
Not

263
00:02:06,472 --> 00:02:07,373
school,

264
00:02:07,373 --> 00:02:07,653
not

265
00:02:07,653 --> 00:02:08,675
success,

266
00:02:08,675 --> 00:02:09,096
not

267
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:09,756
trying

268
00:02:09,756 --> 00:02:09,937
at

269
00:02:09,937 --> 00:02:10,336
things.

270
00:02:10,858 --> 00:02:11,098
You

271
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:11,418
gave

272
00:02:11,418 --> 00:02:11,538
it

273
00:02:11,538 --> 00:02:11,657
a

274
00:02:11,657 --> 00:02:12,438
shot.

275
00:02:12,438 --> 00:02:12,639
The

276
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,240
shot

277
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,020
missed.

278
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:14,341
Hit

279
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:14,542
the

280
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:15,102
ceiling

281
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:15,502
fan.

282
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:16,663
It's

283
00:02:16,663 --> 00:02:17,145
okay

284
00:02:17,145 --> 00:02:17,925
though.

285
00:02:17,925 --> 00:02:18,205
Take

286
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:18,566
another

287
00:02:18,566 --> 00:02:19,046

288
00:02:19,046 --> 00:02:19,604
off.

289
00:02:19,604 --> 00:02:19,985
call

290
00:02:19,985 --> 00:02:20,405
it

291
00:02:20,405 --> 00:02:20,504
a

292
00:02:20,504 --> 00:02:21,287
sabbatical,

293
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:21,927
or

294
00:02:21,927 --> 00:02:23,389
self-discovery,

295
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:24,110
or

296
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,453
depression,

297
00:02:25,453 --> 00:02:25,674
but

298
00:02:25,674 --> 00:02:25,913
make

299
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:25,993
it

300
00:02:25,993 --> 00:02:26,855
aesthetic

301
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:26,955
on

302
00:02:26,955 --> 00:02:27,216
your

303
00:02:27,216 --> 00:02:27,817
stories.

304
00:02:28,618 --> 00:02:28,818
You

305
00:02:28,818 --> 00:02:29,118
want

306
00:02:29,118 --> 00:02:29,240
a

307
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,819
shortcut?

308
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:30,502
A

309
00:02:30,502 --> 00:02:30,842
cheat

310
00:02:30,842 --> 00:02:31,682
code?

311
00:02:31,682 --> 00:02:32,003
Here

312
00:02:32,003 --> 00:02:32,223
it

313
00:02:32,223 --> 00:02:32,405
is.

314
00:02:32,405 --> 00:02:33,385
Stop

315
00:02:33,385 --> 00:02:34,086
pretending

316
00:02:34,086 --> 00:02:34,627
effort

317
00:02:34,627 --> 00:02:35,049
works

318
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:35,229
when

319
00:02:35,229 --> 00:02:35,490
you

320
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:35,770
never

321
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:36,290
applied

322
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:36,350
it.

323
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:37,633
Miracles

324
00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:38,014
don't

325
00:02:38,014 --> 00:02:38,473
scale.

326
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:39,436
Neither

327
00:02:39,436 --> 00:02:39,877
do

328
00:02:39,877 --> 00:02:40,397
pity

329
00:02:40,397 --> 00:02:41,299
extensions.

330
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:42,461
They're

331
00:02:42,461 --> 00:02:42,741
not

332
00:02:42,741 --> 00:02:43,522
mad.

333
00:02:43,522 --> 00:02:43,782
They're

334
00:02:43,782 --> 00:02:44,002
not

335
00:02:44,002 --> 00:02:45,245
disappointed.

336
00:02:45,245 --> 00:02:45,686
They're

337
00:02:45,686 --> 00:02:46,347
just

338
00:02:46,347 --> 00:02:47,295
done.

339
00:02:47,295 --> 00:02:47,656
Your

340
00:02:47,656 --> 00:02:48,317
professors

341
00:02:48,317 --> 00:02:48,717
won't

342
00:02:48,717 --> 00:02:49,018
even

343
00:02:49,018 --> 00:02:49,618
remember

344
00:02:49,618 --> 00:02:49,919
your

345
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,300
name.

346
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,040
You

347
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,260
were

348
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:51,401
a

349
00:02:51,401 --> 00:02:52,002
blurry

350
00:02:52,002 --> 00:02:52,543
box

351
00:02:52,543 --> 00:02:52,682
on

352
00:02:52,682 --> 00:02:52,823
a

353
00:02:52,823 --> 00:02:53,343
laggy

354
00:02:53,343 --> 00:02:53,925
screen

355
00:02:53,925 --> 00:02:54,164
for

356
00:02:54,164 --> 00:02:54,545
three

357
00:02:54,545 --> 00:02:55,326
semesters

358
00:02:55,326 --> 00:02:55,747
straight.

359
00:02:56,568 --> 00:02:56,949
Maybe

360
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:57,248
you

361
00:02:57,248 --> 00:02:57,530
should

362
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:57,849
talk

363
00:02:57,849 --> 00:02:58,010
to

364
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:58,431
someone.

365
00:02:59,192 --> 00:02:59,352
Or

366
00:02:59,352 --> 00:02:59,733
maybe

367
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:00,234
you

368
00:03:00,234 --> 00:03:00,693
already

369
00:03:00,693 --> 00:03:00,974
did,

370
00:03:00,974 --> 00:03:01,574
and

371
00:03:01,574 --> 00:03:02,015
lied

372
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:02,336
through

373
00:03:02,336 --> 00:03:02,576
your

374
00:03:02,576 --> 00:03:02,896
teeth

375
00:03:02,896 --> 00:03:03,318
about

376
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:03,837
how

377
00:03:03,837 --> 00:03:04,258
you're

378
00:03:04,258 --> 00:03:04,740
working

379
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,139
on

380
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:05,240
it.

381
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:06,201
Sure

382
00:03:06,201 --> 00:03:06,602
you

383
00:03:06,602 --> 00:03:07,203
are.

384
00:03:07,203 --> 00:03:07,443
Me

385
00:03:07,443 --> 00:03:07,683
too.

386
00:03:08,525 --> 00:03:08,884
This

387
00:03:08,884 --> 00:03:09,205
isn't

388
00:03:09,205 --> 00:03:09,385
a

389
00:03:09,385 --> 00:03:10,407
setback.

390
00:03:10,407 --> 00:03:10,627
It's

391
00:03:10,627 --> 00:03:10,828
a

392
00:03:10,828 --> 00:03:11,268
pattern.

393
00:03:11,808 --> 00:03:12,069
You're

394
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:12,229
not

395
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:13,390
unlucky.

396
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:13,731
You're

397
00:03:13,731 --> 00:03:14,937
consistent.

398
00:03:14,937 --> 00:03:15,997
consistently

399
00:03:15,997 --> 00:03:16,397
just

400
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:16,818
below

401
00:03:16,818 --> 00:03:17,598
minimum

402
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:18,379
standards.

403
00:03:19,221 --> 00:03:20,201
Graduation's

404
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:20,542
a

405
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:21,562
ceremony,

406
00:03:21,562 --> 00:03:21,782
not

407
00:03:21,782 --> 00:03:22,143
a

408
00:03:22,143 --> 00:03:22,683
miracle.

409
00:03:23,283 --> 00:03:23,443
It

410
00:03:23,443 --> 00:03:23,844
doesn't

411
00:03:23,844 --> 00:03:24,145
come

412
00:03:24,145 --> 00:03:24,365
with

413
00:03:24,365 --> 00:03:24,465
a

medal

416
00:03:26,447 --> 00:03:26,567
or

417
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:26,887
a

418
00:03:26,887 --> 00:03:27,527
do-over.

419
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:28,329
It

420
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:28,729
just

421
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:29,370
moves

422
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:29,469
on,

423
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:30,471
with

424
00:03:30,471 --> 00:03:30,610
or

425
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,070
without

426
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:31,311
you.

427
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:32,472
This

428
00:03:32,472 --> 00:03:32,652
was

429
00:03:32,652 --> 00:03:32,812
the

430
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:33,133
part

431
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:33,353
where

432
00:03:33,353 --> 00:03:33,552
you

433
00:03:33,552 --> 00:03:33,712
were

434
00:03:33,712 --> 00:03:34,213
supposed

435
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:34,394
to

436
00:03:34,394 --> 00:03:34,713
prove

437
00:03:34,713 --> 00:03:34,974
them

438
00:03:34,974 --> 00:03:35,715
wrong,

439
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:35,895
but

440
00:03:35,895 --> 00:03:36,195
you

441
00:03:36,195 --> 00:03:36,475
didn't

442
00:03:36,475 --> 00:03:36,895
even

443
00:03:36,895 --> 00:03:37,217
show

444
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:37,396
up

445
00:03:37,396 --> 00:03:37,556
for

446
00:03:37,556 --> 00:03:37,717
the

447
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,116
scene.

448
00:03:38,116 --> 00:03:38,957
You

449
00:03:38,957 --> 00:03:39,177
let

450
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:39,397
the

451
00:03:39,397 --> 00:03:40,199
montage

452
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:40,620
fade

453
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:40,860
out

454
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,340
before

455
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:41,520
the

456
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,121
climax.

457
00:03:43,002 --> 00:03:43,282
So,

458
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:44,242
now

459
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:44,991
what?

460
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:45,271
You

461
00:03:45,271 --> 00:03:45,973
re-enroll,

462
00:03:45,973 --> 00:03:46,814
try

463
00:03:46,814 --> 00:03:47,115
again,

464
00:03:47,115 --> 00:03:47,155
or

465
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:48,336
maybe

466
00:03:48,336 --> 00:03:48,576
you

467
00:03:48,576 --> 00:03:48,897
just

468
00:03:48,897 --> 00:03:49,258
keep

469
00:03:49,258 --> 00:03:49,758
lying

470
00:03:49,758 --> 00:03:49,899
to

471
00:03:49,899 --> 00:03:50,118
your

472
00:03:50,118 --> 00:03:50,580
parents

473
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:50,881
for

474
00:03:50,881 --> 00:03:51,061
one

475
00:03:51,061 --> 00:03:51,381
more

476
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:52,042
semester,

477
00:03:52,622 --> 00:03:52,802
one

478
00:03:52,802 --> 00:03:53,163
more

479
00:03:53,163 --> 00:03:53,784
deadline

480
00:03:53,784 --> 00:03:54,224
you'll

481
00:03:54,224 --> 00:03:54,506
miss.

482
00:03:55,247 --> 00:03:55,447
But

483
00:03:55,447 --> 00:03:55,828
hey,

484
00:03:55,828 --> 00:03:56,609
don't

485
00:03:56,609 --> 00:03:56,989
feel

486
00:03:56,989 --> 00:03:57,349
bad.

487
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:58,110
You

488
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:58,491
still

489
00:03:58,491 --> 00:03:58,972
learn

490
00:03:58,972 --> 00:03:59,473
something.

491
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:00,373
How

492
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:00,574
to

493
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:01,175
pretend,

494
00:04:01,756 --> 00:04:02,037
how

495
00:04:02,037 --> 00:04:02,236
to

496
00:04:02,236 --> 00:04:02,516
hope,

497
00:04:03,057 --> 00:04:03,378
how

498
00:04:03,378 --> 00:04:03,658
to

499
00:04:03,658 --> 00:04:04,080
coast.

500
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:05,001
It's

501
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:05,282
just

502
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:06,383
nobody

503
00:04:06,383 --> 00:04:06,723
gives

504
00:04:06,723 --> 00:04:07,123
you

505
00:04:07,123 --> 00:04:07,204
a

506
00:04:07,204 --> 00:04:07,745
degree

507
00:04:07,745 --> 00:04:08,205
for

508
00:04:08,205 --> 00:04:08,506
that.

509
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:10,128
So,

510
00:04:10,128 --> 00:04:10,568
here's

511
00:04:10,568 --> 00:04:10,870
your

512
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,070
diploma,

513
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,171
a

514
00:04:12,171 --> 00:04:12,832
reality

515
00:04:12,832 --> 00:04:13,627
check.

516
00:04:13,627 --> 00:04:13,929
You

517
00:04:13,929 --> 00:04:14,371
didn't

518
00:04:14,371 --> 00:04:14,792
pass

519
00:04:14,792 --> 00:04:14,953
the

520
00:04:14,953 --> 00:04:15,294
test,

521
00:04:15,816 --> 00:04:15,977
but

522
00:04:15,977 --> 00:04:16,257
you're

523
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:16,598
still

524
00:04:16,598 --> 00:04:17,000
here,

525
00:04:17,562 --> 00:04:17,663
and

526
00:04:17,663 --> 00:04:17,983
that

527
00:04:17,983 --> 00:04:18,305
means

528
00:04:18,305 --> 00:04:18,947
you

529
00:04:18,947 --> 00:04:19,168
get

530
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:19,408
to

531
00:04:19,408 --> 00:04:19,850
try

532
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:20,172
again.

533
00:04:20,172 --> 00:04:20,211
Or

534
00:04:21,074 --> 00:04:21,536
don't.

535
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:22,802
Honestly,

536
00:04:22,802 --> 00:04:24,127
nobody's

537
00:04:24,127 --> 00:04:24,769
watching.
