So, you failed the technical interview. Again. Okay, first of all, who the hell uses bubble sort in 2025? Be honest, was that a joke? You thought the interviewer wouldn't notice you googling during the coding round? You all tabbed six times in 20 minutes. I counted. You wrote a binary search on an unsorted array? You didn't just fail, you redefined what it means to not understand big O.

00:00:27,722 --> 00:00:46,387
I made 7 tutorials on this exact question. You watched none. But you watched that guy speedrun Elden Ring for 6 hours. Nice use of time bro. They gave you fizz buzz. Fizz buzz. That's not even a test. It's a vibe check. And somehow you failed the vibe.

3
00:00:46,387 --> 00:01:02,890
Pointers don't even talk to me about pointers. You dereferenced null and then blamed the interviewer. What were you pointing at? Hope? They said implement a linked list. You said, do I really need to know this in real life? Bro, it was a LinkedIn interview.

4
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:21,266
know your audience and recursion you made a recursive function with no base case you made a black hole not a program you used a hash map to sort an array a hash map that's like using a blender to iron your clothes technically possible but why

5
00:01:21,772 --> 00:01:45,313
Look, I know you've been grinding lead code, but grinding doesn't help if you copy-paste the wrong solution. Half your code didn't compile, the other half just cried. You said the time complexity was O of 1, unless the array is like big or something. What does that even mean? Did you invent a new notation? Is this quantum DSA?

6
00:01:45,313 --> 00:02:06,727
You know what hurts the most? That you are not even stupid. You are just lazy. You want the job but not the struggle. You want the title but not the function. You watched my video at 1.5x speed and thought you absorbed recursion through osmosis. You didn't. You skipped the hard parts and clapped for yourself anyway.

7
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:27,080
And now you're here, crying about rejection emails like they're personal attacks. They're not. They're feedback. Brutal, corporate, algorithmically polite feedback. You had the time. You had the resources. You had the audacity to believe you'd just wing it. And guess what? You got winged.

8
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:45,945
They gave you a chance. You gave them confusion, stack overflows and emotional damage. That was your final round. Not final boss. Final warning. You want to break into fang? Bro, you can't even break into your own GitHub repo without taking Stack Overflow twice.

9
00:02:45,945 --> 00:03:10,312
Look, you failed. Fine. But don't waste this. Either get serious about this path or walk away and stop pretending. I am not mad. I am not disappointed. I am just telling you, this is what it looks like when you don't respect the grind. You don't need more tutorials. You need to become the version of yourself who wouldn't have failed that interview. That guy, he doesn't need me.
