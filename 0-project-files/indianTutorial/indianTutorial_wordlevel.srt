You

27
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:14,140

You're

thought

310
00:02:14,795 --> 00:02:14,936
you

311
00:02:14,936 --> 00:02:15,456
absorbed

You

316
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:17,939
didn't.

317
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:18,762
You

318
00:02:18,762 --> 00:02:19,081
skipped

319
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:19,201

00:02:20,685 --> 00:02:21,185
yourself

326
00:02:21,185 --> 00:02:22,102
anyway.

327
00:02:22,102 --> 00:02:22,401
And

328
00:02:22,401 --> 00:02:22,943
now,

329
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:23,203
you're

They're

disappointed

443
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:15,659
I'm

444
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:15,879
just

445
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:16,200
telling

446
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,801
you,

447
00:03:16,801 --> 00:03:17,043
this

448
00:03:17,043 --> 00:03:17,163
is

449
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:17,403
what

450
00:03:17,403 --> 00:03:17,544
it

451
00:03:17,544 --> 00:03:17,805
looks

452
00:03:17,805 --> 00:03:18,085
like

453
00:03:18,085 --> 00:03:18,246
when

454
00:03:18,246 --> 00:03:18,425
you

455
00:03:18,425 --> 00:03:18,747
don't

456
00:03:18,747 --> 00:03:19,307
respect

457
00:03:19,307 --> 00:03:19,468
the

458
00:03:19,468 --> 00:03:19,909
grind.

459
00:03:20,691 --> 00:03:20,872
You

460
00:03:20,872 --> 00:03:21,132
don't

461
00:03:21,132 --> 00:03:21,413
need

462
00:03:21,413 --> 00:03:21,653

466
00:03:23,176 --> 00:03:23,337
to

467
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:23,677
become

468
00:03:23,677 --> 00:03:23,838
the

469
00:03:23,838 --> 00:03:24,240
version

470
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,340
of

471
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,442
yourself

472
00:03:25,442 --> 00:03:25,603
who

473
00:03:25,603 --> 00:03:25,963
wouldn't

474
00:03:25,963 --> 00:03:26,183
have

475
00:03:26,183 --> 00:03:26,444

476
00:03:26,444 --> 00:03:26,745

477
00:03:26,745 --> 00:03:27,266
interview.

478
00:03:27,266 --> 00:03:28,169

480
00:03:28,429 --> 00:03:29,031
he

481
00:03:29,031 --> 00:03:29,331
doesn't

482
00:03:29,331 --> 00:03:29,611
need

483
00:03:29,611 --> 00:03:29,992
