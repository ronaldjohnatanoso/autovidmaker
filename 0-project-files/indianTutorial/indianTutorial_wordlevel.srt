You

27
00:00:11,242 --> 00:00:11,602

00:02:06,385 --> 00:02:07,206
didn't.

317
00:02:07,206 --> 00:02:07,367
You

318
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:07,727

anyway.

327
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:11,211
And

430
00:02:58,608 --> 00:02:59,288
path

431
00:02:59,288 --> 00:02:59,389
or

432
00:02:59,389 --> 00:02:59,868
walk

433
00:02:59,868 --> 00:03:00,109
away

434
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:00,229
and

435
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:00,550
stop

436
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,170
pretending.

437
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,151
I'm

438
00:03:02,151 --> 00:03:02,391
not

439
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:03,133
mad.

440
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:03,312
I'm

441
00:03:03,312 --> 00:03:03,532
not

442
00:03:03,532 --> 00:03:04,174
disappointed.

443
00:03:04,694 --> 00:03:04,914
I'm

444
00:03:04,914 --> 00:03:05,115
just

445
00:03:05,115 --> 00:03:05,455
telling

446
00:03:05,455 --> 00:03:05,616
you,

447
00:03:06,216 --> 00:03:06,537
this

448
00:03:06,537 --> 00:03:06,676
is

449
00:03:06,676 --> 00:03:06,917
what

450
00:03:06,917 --> 00:03:07,037
it

451
00:03:07,037 --> 00:03:07,337
looks

452
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:07,598
like

453
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:07,777
when

454
00:03:07,777 --> 00:03:07,979
you

455
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:08,338
don't

456
00:03:08,338 --> 00:03:08,939
respect

457
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:09,120
the

458
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,500
grind.

459
00:03:10,281 --> 00:03:10,461
You

460
00:03:10,461 --> 00:03:10,701
don't

461
00:03:10,701 --> 00:03:10,921
need

462
00:03:10,921 --> 00:03:11,102
more

463
00:03:11,102 --> 00:03:12,062
tutorials.

464
00:03:12,062 --> 00:03:12,242
You

465
00:03:12,242 --> 00:03:12,524
need

466
00:03:12,524 --> 00:03:12,764
to

467
00:03:12,764 --> 00:03:13,245
become

468
00:03:13,245 --> 00:03:13,444
the

469
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:13,905
version

470
00:03:13,905 --> 00:03:14,004
of

471
00:03:14,004 --> 00:03:14,765
yourself

472
00:03:14,765 --> 00:03:14,986
who

473
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:15,387
wouldn't

474
00:03:15,387 --> 00:03:15,567
have

475
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:15,828
failed

476
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:16,008
that

477
00:03:16,008 --> 00:03:16,448
interview.

478
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:17,209
That

479
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:17,810
guy,

480
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:17,969
he

481
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:18,289
doesn't

482
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:18,570
need

483
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:18,770
me.
