walk

430
00:02:52,358 --> 00:02:52,878
away

431
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:53,039
and

432
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:53,360
stop

433
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:53,941
pretending.

434
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:54,622
I’m

435
00:02:54,622 --> 00:02:54,862
not

436
00:02:54,862 --> 00:02:55,524
mad.

437
00:02:55,524 --> 00:02:55,724
I’m

438
00:02:55,724 --> 00:02:55,944
not

439
00:02:55,944 --> 00:02:57,067
disappointed.

440
00:02:57,067 --> 00:02:57,247
I’m

441
00:02:57,247 --> 00:02:57,467
just

442
00:02:57,467 --> 00:02:57,788
telling

443
00:02:57,788 --> 00:02:58,370
you:

444
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:58,629
this

445
00:02:58,629 --> 00:02:58,770
is

446
00:02:58,770 --> 00:02:59,010
what

447
00:02:59,010 --> 00:02:59,110
it

448
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,412
looks

449
00:02:59,412 --> 00:02:59,832
like

450
00:02:59,832 --> 00:02:59,992
when

451
00:02:59,992 --> 00:03:00,213
you

452
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:00,533
don’t

453
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:00,955
respect

454
00:03:00,955 --> 00:03:01,094
the

455
00:03:01,094 --> 00:03:01,415
grind.

456
00:03:02,097 --> 00:03:02,298
You

457
00:03:02,298 --> 00:03:02,598
don’t

458
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:02,859
need

459
00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:03,079
more

460
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:04,061
tutorials.

461
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:04,241
You

462
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:04,461
need

463
00:03:04,461 --> 00:03:04,641
to

464
00:03:04,641 --> 00:03:05,082
become

465
00:03:05,082 --> 00:03:05,223
the

466
00:03:05,223 --> 00:03:05,644
version

467
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:05,764
of

468
00:03:05,764 --> 00:03:06,425
yourself

469
00:03:06,425 --> 00:03:06,586
who

470
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:06,925
wouldn’t

471
00:03:06,925 --> 00:03:07,146
have

472
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:07,467
failed

473
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:07,668
that

474
00:03:07,668 --> 00:03:08,468
interview.

475
00:03:08,468 --> 00:03:08,689
That

476
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,230
guy?

477
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:09,411
He

478
00:03:09,411 --> 00:03:09,771
doesn’t

479
00:03:09,771 --> 00:03:10,032
need

480
00:03:10,032 --> 00:03:10,332
me.
