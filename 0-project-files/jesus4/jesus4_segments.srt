Gather round, child. Got a story Jesus told in Matthew 13 about seeds and soil. Been farming most my life, this one hits deep. Jesus sat by the water, crowds pressing in, told him about a sower who went out to plant. Now this farmer, he scattered seed everywhere, didn't pick and choose where it fell.

2
00:00:26,844 --> 00:00:54,706
Some fell on the path, hard ground beaten down. Birds came quick and snatched it up. Other seeds hit rocky places. Sprouted fast and shallow dirt looked promising at first. But when the sun got hot, they withered, no deep roots to draw from. Some fell among thorns, started growing good, then got choked out by weeds.

3
00:00:55,076 --> 00:01:17,638
The seed that hid good soil? Lord, have mercy. Thirty, sixty, a hundred times what was planted. Later, disciples asked, what's it mean, master? They would scratch their heads like we do. Jesus said the seed is God's word, but the soil, that's the human heart.

4
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:39,712
The hard path, that's a closed heart. Word bounces right off. Satan comes quick, steals the truth before it can settle in. Rocky soil, that's the heart that gets excited at first. Yes, Lord, I believe. But when trouble come, when faith costs something, they're gone.

5
00:01:40,471 --> 00:01:59,454
Thorny ground, that's the heart choked by worry, riches, and pleasures of this world. Here's the word, but it gets crowded out, no room to grow. But good soil, that's the honest heart, hears, understands, holds on tight.

6
00:01:59,572 --> 00:02:18,658
bears fruit that lasts, changes lives, helps others, stays faithful through seasons. So which soil are you, friend? Don't answer quick. Think honest. God's word falls the same on everyone. The difference is what we do with it.

7
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:46,435
Good news, soil can change. Hard hearts can be broken up. Shallow ground can be deepened. Thorns can be pulled out. Maybe tonight's the night and your heart becomes good soil. Let his word take root deep. Don't let the bird steal it. Grow dim roots down where storms can't shake you. And watch God bring a harvest from your life you never imagined.
