read in a deep voice of an old man
Speaker 1: Gather 'round, child. Got a story Jesus told in Matthew thirteen. About seeds and soil. Been farmin' most my life — this one hits deep.
Jesus sat by the water, crowds pressin' in. Told 'em about a sower who went out to plant.
Now this farmer, he scattered seed everywhere. Didn't pick and choose where it fell.
Some fell on the path — hard ground, beaten down. Birds came quick and snatched it up.
Other seeds hit rocky places. Sprouted fast in shallow dirt, looked promising at first.
But when the sun got hot, they withered. No deep roots to draw from.
Some fell among thorns. Started growin' good, then got choked out by weeds.
But the seed that hit good soil? Lord have mercy — thirty, sixty, a hundred times what was planted.
Later, disciples asked, "What's it mean, Master?" They were scratched their heads like we do.
Jesus said, "The seed is God's Word. But the soil — that's the human heart."
The hard path? That's a closed heart. Word bounces right off.
Satan comes quick, steals the truth before it can settle in.
Rocky soil? That's the heart that gets excited at first. "Yes, Lord! I believe!"
But when trouble comes, when faith costs somethin' — they're gone.
Thorny ground? That's the heart choked by worry, riches, pleasures of this world.
Hears the Word, but it gets crowded out. No room to grow.
But good soil — that's the honest heart. Hears, understands, holds on tight.
Bears fruit that lasts. Changes lives, helps others, stays faithful through seasons.
So which soil are you, friend? Don't answer quick — think honest.
God's Word falls the same on everyone. The difference is what we do with it.
Good news — soil can change. Hard hearts can be broken up.
Shallow ground can be deepened. Thorns can be pulled out.
Maybe tonight's the night your heart becomes good soil.
Let His Word take root deep. Don't let the birds steal it.
Grow them roots down where storms can't shake you.
And watch God bring a harvest from your life you never imagined.
If this Word took root in your heart tonight, type AMEN in the comments.
