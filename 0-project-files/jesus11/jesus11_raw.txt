Speaker 1: Jesus talked about HELL more than anyone else! What He said will SHOCK you!
Everyone thought they knew who was going to hell...
But Jesus said the RELIGIOUS people would fill it!
The ones praying on street corners for show...
Jesus said THEY'D be first in line!
While the prostitutes and tax collectors got saved!
He wept because religion WITHOUT relationship leads to hell!
Are you just playing church or do you KNOW Him?
Jesus said many will say "Lord, Lord" but He'll say "I never knew you!"
It's not about being religious - it's about being REAL!
Type AMEN if you want REAL relationship with Jesus! Subscribe for more truth!
