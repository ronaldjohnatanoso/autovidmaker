Ladies, gentlemen, unknowable entities from beyond. Listen close. Lord Cthulhu isn't just a cosmic nightmare. He's your next spiritual investment. For the low, low price of eternal devotion and occasional blood sacrifice, you too can be part of the Elder God retirement plan. Tentacles included.

Don't wait, he's waking up, he's cranky, and he knows who's been naughty. This isn't Santa Claus, this is Santa Claus, with fangs and regret. Every day is a good day to accept a writhing ancient sea horror into your heart or liver, whichever one he prefers to nest in. He's flexible.

Family friendly? You bet. Little Timmy already built a shrine out of macaroni and glitter. Cthulhu ate it. And Timmy. But in a loving way. Breakfast? He provides. Tentacle waffles. Chaos syrup. A complete and balanced apocalypse. Election year? He's already your overlord. Voting is futile. But you can endorse him to save your kneecaps. I cannot stress this enough.

Merch? Yes. Existential Dread? Comes free. Worship Kits start at $6.66. Comes with candle, chance sheet, and a map to your local abyss. Questions? We have a support line. It just screams. But screaming is answers, if you think about it, which you shouldn't. Ever.

He's coming, whether you like it or not, so why not get on his good side while you still have sides? Sign up today, get a free tentacle massage and a chance to be spared for at least one lunar cycle. No guarantees, but still, hope? Worship Thulu, save your soul, or at least make it spicy for him to eat. Don't be a soul snack, be a soul experience.
