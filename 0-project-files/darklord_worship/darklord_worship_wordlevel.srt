00:00:27,515 --> 00:00:27,675
he's

52
00:00:27,734 --> 00:00:28,216
cranky,

53
00:00:28,576 --> 00:00:28,655

70
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:36,744
regret.

00:00:37,545 --> 00:00:37,826
Every

Timmy.

118
00:00:57,299 --> 00:00:57,420
But

Chaos

129
00:01:03,686 --> 00:01:04,465

A

133
00:01:05,527 --> 00:01:05,987
balanced

134
00:01:06,388 --> 00:01:07,049

Voting

142
00:01:11,472 --> 00:01:11,552

143
00:01:11,612 --> 00:01:12,173
futile.

144
00:01:12,554 --> 00:01:12,674
But

145
00:01:12,713 --> 00:01:12,813
you

146
00:01:12,834 --> 00:01:12,953

you

196
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:37,632

so

212
00:01:43,391 --> 00:01:43,611
why
