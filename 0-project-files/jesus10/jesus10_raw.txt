Speaker 1: These 3 words made JESUS CRY! When God Himself weeps, you NEED to pay attention!
After feeding 5,000 people, they ALL walked away!
Jesus turned to His closest friends and asked...
"Will you leave too?"
Peter said, "Lord, where else would we go?"
"You have the words of eternal life!"
Everyone else might abandon Him, but what about YOU?
He's asking YOU right now: "Will you leave too?"
Your answer determines your ETERNITY!
Tell Him: "Jesus, I'll NEVER leave You!"
Type AMEN if you're staying with Jesus! Subscribe if you'll never abandon Him!
